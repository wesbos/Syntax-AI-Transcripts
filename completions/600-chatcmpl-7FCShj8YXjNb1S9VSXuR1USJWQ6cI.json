Prepare for Scott Zelensky and Wes Bos!\n\n00:12 Wes Bos:\nWelcome to Syntax, the tastiest web dev podcast. On episode 600 today! How's it going, Scott?\n\n00:23 Scott Tolinski:\nHey, I'm great, caffeinated, and had a big life change - got a tattoo, West.\n\n00:33 Wes Bos:\nYeah, I saw that. Can you share about that before the major announcement? You saw in the major announcement, Deno.\n\n00:44 Scott Tolinski:\nI got two penguins for my visual podcast, and they're very cute! I've been on the waiting list for this tattoo, and I'm super excited.\n\n00:56 Wes Bos:\nFeels great, looks sick. Let's dive into our 600th episode. We can't believe we've gotten this far and have a big announcement: Syntax Podcast is joining Sentry! We've worked on this for months and are excited to explain what it means for the show - we're not going anywhere, but we'll get even better. We will share our ideas and plans for the future. Today, we have guest David Kramer, the co-founder of Sentry. Welcome!\n\n01:47 Guest 3:\nHappy to be here! Can't wait to learn about Scott's penguins. Not sure if it's a Linux thing, but we'll see.\n\n01:56 Scott Tolinski:\nSo, I got penguins for my wife and me, symbolizing lifelong partnership, like penguins mate for life. It's a sweet marriage gesture. Better than getting a tattoo of each other's names. Now, let's discuss the century thing. Go for it, Scott.\n\n02:25 Guest 3:\nGo for it, Scott.\n\n02:28 Scott Tolinski:\nYeah, put me on the spot. So, last year, we started discussing where this podcast could go, and found we were all aligned in vision and felt we could achieve more together than apart. Honestly, partnering with Century felt perfect for the podcast's future, allowing control over its direction while maintaining its heart. Importantly, Century doesn't change the podcast's essence – rather, they enhance it. We all have many ideas for improvement.\n\n03:53 Wes Bos:\nWe're excited to increase this podcast from once a week to three times a week due to many ideas and topics to explore but face limited time and resources. Century's partnership is perfect as they've been partners with the podcast and my courses for years. About 6-7 years ago, when I released my Redux course, Ben from Century reached out for collaboration, and we showed how to use Century in one of the videos. Unlike the scripted proposals I receive daily, they approached me with genuine curiosity.\n\nI have always been a fan of Century and am glad they are on board. We have also been customers of Vercel before our sponsorship with them. We've used Century for a long time, and their support has been valuable.\n\n05:20 Scott Tolinski:\nYou know, we've been collaborating with the sponsorship realm since 2018. This podcast, a labor of love for both West and me, now allows us to fully dedicate our efforts. Initially a side project, it has transitioned into my main focus, which is super exciting.\n\n05:54 Wes Bos:\nWhat else does this mean? Our podcast will be free, as many requested a Patreon or ad-free option, but I want our content accessible to everyone in the community. So, no more ads on the podcast, no selling to companies or ad reads upfront, and no need to skip 30 seconds anymore.\n\n06:29 Scott Tolinski:\nThey're no longer on the podcast and won't rely on ads, which is exciting. The Patreon approach ensures access to educational web development content for everyone without charging. This aligns with the mission of providing free, accessible content like the thousands of YouTube videos that helped jumpstart my career.\n\nCentury's support allows for show improvements, and audience benefits in numerous ways. One anticipated addition is video episodes, though not a commitment for next week. With coding being a visual medium and both hosts experienced in live video coding, the podcast will soon have a visual component to show alongside the discussion. This highly requested feature – appearing on platforms like Twitch or YouTube – will happen.\n\n08:10 Wes Bos:\nDefinitely. So, David, do people call you Kramer or David? Can I call you Kramer? What's the story behind that?\n\n08:21 Guest 3:\nKramer has always been a catchy last name, so when I got married, I wanted to keep it. When I joined Dropbox as their 300th employee, they asked for my desired email address. I suggested \"david@dropbox,\" but since there were already 50 other Davids, I chose \"kramer\" instead. Both names are good, but Kramer is easier to remember and stands out among many common white first names like David.\n\n08:57 Wes Bos:\nSure. So, why approach you with this idea and what's the vision for syntax?\n\n09:09 Guest 3:\nSo, you'd know I have many unconventional ideas about what's important. A lot of what we've done at Century focused on doing what felt right, not just making savvy business moves. I've always favored syntax and authenticity.\n\nA few years ago, we started a billboard campaign with bizarre images, like a minotaur playing beat saber, captioned \"Century can't fix this.\" It's brand advertising that generates curiosity, and we invest time in our visual identity. My co-founder, Chris, agrees.\n\nWorking with syntax was great for ROI, and listeners appreciated the genuine content. We resonated with how people wanted access to real conversations, rather than something manufactured.\n\nConnecting with the skate decks made us feel like we found our people. Despite not being skateboarders, we wanted our logo to have a skate brand vibe. We aimed for cool and interesting.\n\nWe believe in doing things authentically that add value, regardless of other businesses' approaches. It's why Century focuses on what matters to us and doing things in our unique way. The connection with syntax was special for us.\n\n12:01 Wes Bos:\nI noticed your vinyl ESLint 1 82 Enima of the State, an old Blink album, and thought, this guy's cool. The syntax logo has grunge, and it's interesting how these elements overlap. I'm passionate about infusing our style and vibe into syntax instead of making it just another polished thing, since there are already so many of those.\n\n12:34 Scott Tolinski:\nSolacepodcasts or personalities seem to push content similar to AI-generated stuff. Regarding Blinkway 2's West and Cramer, West has been attempting to create a podcast intro using \"What's My Age Again?\" with lyrics altered to focus on syntax. This idea has been occupying my thoughts lately.\n\n13:02 Wes Bos:\nKicked off the podcast players, maybe it's time for a Blinkway 2 intro. West, it could be better if you use it yourself. I wrote a \"What's my age again?\" intro and found a guy on Fiverr who sounds like Blink to record it. Scott said we'd get sued, but I disagreed. Now that the liability is off Scott and me, could we use it?\n\n13:43 Guest 3:\nYeah, we can do 10 intros. Working with legal is fine; I've tried to be an intern to learn more. There's a YouTube guy who does covers like Third Eye Blind and Blink-182, making songs in their style. I'll send it to you - it's pretty good. We should do something like that, and West should sing it.\n\n14:18 Wes Bos:\nI found it fascinating that the ROI on Century sponsorship has been great despite them merely providing a coupon code and occasional updates. It's incredible that someone can pay so much for podcast sponsorship and simply allow you to riff on it.\n\n14:46 Guest 3:\nI think that helps, West. During our discussion about the deal and confidentiality, our marketing team mentioned that we might not renew the syntax sponsorship, which is our best one. I reassured them that we're working on a partnership and it’s all good.\n\n15:14 Scott Tolinski:\nWe've been receiving emails with new talking points for ad reads, and it's unclear what we can say and to whom. David had to communicate with a few individuals regarding this. It's quite amusing since we usually handle these conversations on our own.\n\n15:37 Guest 3:\nIt'll be okay, you know.\n\n15:39 Scott Tolinski:\nYeah. That's so funny.\n\n15:41 Wes Bos:\nThat's great. Let's discuss what this means for improving syntax in the future. Although not everything is finalized, the general aim is for more high-quality content. This could include video discussions and ESLint clips since many valuable insights from this podcast are buried within longer episodes. Essentially, our goal is to better showcase these nuggets of wisdom.\n\n16:25 Scott Tolinski:\nI'm joining Century full time, and so is Caitlin Bloom from the Level Up course. Caitlin will help us interact more with the community and work on tasks like clip pulling. She'll focus on surfacing our best old episodes, which are still relevant and modern, to bring that content back into the community for everyone's benefit.\n\n17:09 Guest 3:\nThis is a significant component as well. From Century's perspective, we have around 400 people, and with them, numerous skill sets. Our creative team, including full-time video staff and talented illustrators, will enable us to execute cool ideas more easily and quickly than outsourcing to contractors. This also sidesteps the need to secure funding through ads or sponsorships, adding to our excitement.\n\n17:49 Scott Tolinski:\nA significant aspect of our syntax job involves managing sponsors. While we appreciate working with them, tasks like emails, spreadsheets, and invoicing aren't our favorites. Eliminating these tasks will greatly benefit our time and allow us to focus on content creation, which we truly enjoy.\n\n18:19 Wes Bos:\nInterestingly, with the sponsorship, many suggested outsourcing it. However, our sponsors wanted to talk to Scott and me since we're on the podcast. They expected us to genuinely use and understand the product, making it more than just sharing a coupon code, like with MeUndies. That's probably why Century 1 works well, as I use it daily.\n\nThere's an array of new content and announcements coming, but if you have ideas for what Syntax should do, feel free to tweet us your thoughts. It's exciting to think bigger with this platform.\n\n19:17 Scott Tolinski:\nyou know, syntax used to be a Monday project for ESLint I, not a full week. Now, with resources and people like Kramer mentioned at Century, we can think bigger and differently. Instead of cramming everything into Monday morning, it's like,\n\n19:40 Guest 3:\nWhat can we do? It's exciting. Personally, I'm thrilled to see the podcast's growth, and we've discussed possibilities. It's intriguing to push boundaries where people don't usually try or care. Many great ideas exist, and it's about applying this thinking to our work. Brands like Porsche excel in details and recognition, while popular clothing brands make me question their success.\n\nRecently, I've considered trying live events, inspired by posh founder events I've attended with great food, classy drinks, and high-quality discussions, in contrast with regular meetups. Testing it with Syntax could be fascinating since we have a budget and can experiment without much risk. It opens up many opportunities.\n\n21:17 Wes Bos:\nDefinitely. When not focusing on profit, more creativity emerges. For example, making unique t-shirts and printing skate decks. We reminisced about JSconf from 10+ years ago, held at nice resorts with a free day to mingle. Many big names in JavaScript attended, creating lasting memories and connections. My wife and I still talk about it and maintain friendships. Since it stopped, nothing similar has happened. Maybe it's our time to bring it back and share our vibe.\n\n22:26 Scott Tolinski:\nTo sum it up, the overall vibe of syntax won't change. We primarily stand for positivity, curiosity, and excitement about tech, and those aspects will continue to permeate our future actions, including the podcast. And don't worry, the stupid stuff, like monster truck intros, isn't going away.\n\n23:02 Wes Bos:\nShowed up to everybody who's at our intros were kinda cringe.\n\n23:07 Scott Tolinski:\nLike, episode 2 or 3, I'm unsure about this tasty treat. Kinda, yeah. Congrats, you understood the 0.\n\n23:18 Wes Bos:\nThat's good. Forgot to mention, Scott and Vercel Up tutorials are joining full time, while I'm part-time, still creating my courses. I'll invest more time into Syntax for better content. So, David Kramer, you're joining both. Share your background, including your lead up to Dropbox and why you started Century.\n\n24:02 Guest 3:\nI enjoy building things, and I'm good at typing and math, so I figured I could build software. I'm a stereotype of a dropout turned founder, hopefully leading to a successful company. I started writing code when I was 15 using IRC and Mirc on Windows. My passion led me to the internet, social scene, and video games, working on tech websites. I believe if you spend time on something you enjoy, it'll benefit you.\n\nI embraced open source and Century was one of the many projects I built. I worked in Silicon Valley for Discuss and Dropbox, and then Century began. We'll be celebrating the 15th anniversary of Century's first commit soon, which is wild to me. The company's been around for over 10 years and the business started growing in 2015.\n\nI'm a software engineer and started Century with my buddy Chris Jennings, who runs our creative function. I still enjoy building things and writing code. We're curious people, drawn to solving problems. Now, running a large company with 400 employees and 4.5 offices, I'm still curious about how we can continue to grow and improve.\n\n26:40 Wes Bos:\nSo, you're not only into obscure JavaScript and remix stuff, but also tweeted about writing the first run of Century's React dashboard. You initially used Angular and Embber, and when Ben Vininger joined Century, he completed the work you started.\n\n27:10 Guest 3:\nSo, I joke about this at work - it's like in tribal villages where you battle someone to become the leader. I tell people, if you can type faster than me, you can be in charge. I'm good at cranking things out, I'm genuinely curious, and I enjoy building software and solving problems. Half of what I do, I do to satisfy that curiosity.\n\nOne unsatisfied part of my job is not working on Century itself from a technical perspective. So, I try to fill that void with other projects. My tweets often revolve around current tasks, sometimes complaining about other things, not Tailwind. It's a passion, and I feel fortunate, like you all, to make a career out of something I enjoy doing.\n\n28:27 Wes Bos:\nMy goal in life is not to expand so much that I can't spend mornings exploring new CSS specs or implementing ideas to fix things. We seem aligned on that. Also, do you think being code-focused contributes to Century's success since it's a product for developers, but it appears you've never\n\n28:59 Guest 3:\nYeah, people often ask if I have intentional tunnel vision and I believe I do. One challenge at Century is building software for every kind of developer - web app, mobile app, desktop application, or even a John Deere tractor. There are limits to my technical knowledge, but we try to focus on technical vision and having opinions at the company.\n\nMany companies and podcasts can be soulless. They just build features without caring about the point of it all. I hope we never become that type of company. It's essential to spend time on interesting and fun things, and for me, that's the tech and building a product for myself.\n\n30:23 Scott Tolinski:\nit's hard not to relate to your stuff. The typing faster mentality is like the b-boy mindset in breaking scene. If you're better than the judge, call them out and prove it. We're all here because we love it, and genuine connections form. The partnership with Century has been great in more ways than we can describe. We never thought they weren't a good fit based on our conversations. We were aligned in our visions, making the process less scary. Joining a company while working on a project for 5 years can be daunting, but we want to make sure it's not just about podcasting.\n\n31:45 Wes Bos:\ntracking errors, is it? Yes. Of course, it's not. Right? But, like,\n\n31:49 Guest 3:\nWe need to ensure the listener understands the importance of balancing our responsibilities towards shareholders, the business, and protecting people. We genuinely believe syntax is great and want to invest in ESLint, not just for some hidden business move. Many have been burned by acquisitions, and we don't want this to be just another soulless endeavor.\n\nReferring to the JS conf example, we miss the days when people were genuinely curious and like-minded, rather than focusing on making money in the tech industry. We'd like to bring back those connections and community interactions that were once prevalent. While discussing the old days might seem nostalgic, we genuinely yearn to reintroduce that essence.\n\n33:05 Wes Bos:\nthe RSS feed with new, exciting blog posts like web designer wall, smashy meg, or Nick Law's website amazed me. I felt like the world is my oyster with endless possibilities using CSS and other innovative things.\n\n33:29 Guest 3:\nthat has changed, and I hope we can bring back that vibe. We all had different inspirations but shared values. Much of my inspiration was from in-person events like GitHub's happy hours and conferences like jsconf. COVID made us forget the value of these events for learning and networking.\n\nA standout event was Strange Loop, known for its advanced talks and attracting experts. It's an artifact of a different era that's fading away, but I encouraged the team to attend if they're interested. With IRC declining and other platforms like Discord emerging, it's not the same.\n\nThe world is bigger with more people, but if we can regain that sense of belonging and shared curiosity, we'll be successful. It's about keeping the essence of IRC without losing connection.\n\n35:00 Scott Tolinski:\ngetting kicked for repeating a question 8 others asked. I recall joining drupal 1, facing a white screen, and people telling me to leave. Raised on IRC, I also experienced running a bouncer.\n\n35:22 Wes Bos:\nThe conferences, like jsconf, were great since we knew familiar people. It had 3 tracks of talks, plus track s for swimming if you didn't want to attend a talk. Pretty excited about such elements. I wonder, will Century dictate our topics and what we're allowed to discuss?\n\n35:48 Guest 3:\nI don't know much about marketing; I mostly make things up, and sometimes it works. With branding, it's more about awareness – build something good, let developers know about it, and they might buy or use it. If Century helps Syntax, that's great for us, and if it solves a problem, people will look at Century. That's how we grow our brand and equity.\n\nNot everyone will agree with this approach, but it's worked well for us. Century became successful because I spoke at many Python conferences, not to sell, but to share interesting and authentic insights. That's how we built brand loyalty – by being trustworthy. We constantly educate new hires on the importance of living these values, and that's evident in the success of the show and community.\n\nSomeone recently asked about my ROI on TikTok, but I don't track that. It's not about selling a specific number of items; it's about creating genuine connections and awareness.\n\n38:06 Wes Bos:\nThe concept is to consistently contribute and participate in the community, hopefully earning a living due to the trust and appreciation of your brand for paid services. Simultaneously, you explore your own curiosity.\n\n38:24 Scott Tolinski:\nEnhance your skills; make cool things and improve. It's enjoyable, like video creation. I have some questions for David too - Will the brand need to stay purple from now on?\n\n38:44 Guest 3:\nYou know, I've worked with purple brands before, so it's no problem. But do we need to become purple? We made purple popular after taking it from Heroku. I love your brand's grunge and uniqueness; it's important and well-done. Century has its identity, similar to how CodeCov, which we acquired, has its own brand. Whether they merge design-wise is up to them. But there's no need to switch unless you want to; the yellow pnpm and gold water themes work well.\n\n39:36 Scott Tolinski:\nfor websites. Like, developing a theme. For the new syntax site, I'll create a century purple theme.\n\n39:48 Guest 3:\nThere's a way, 64 things about it. It's a terrible idea but I'm good at those. We talked about this after April 1st. No liability, trust me. World famous hot boys dot com is a food chain with a nineties website look. What if we change the century's site to a GOCs style?\n\n40:20 Scott Tolinski:\nTotal.\n\n40:21 Guest 3:\nA Geocities theme could be amazing and hilarious, right?\n\n40:28 Wes Bos:\nPeople want honesty, right? It's funny and their website is amazing. I don't know the company, but I want the hat that says \"hot boys.\" Scott, the new site is exciting – we discussed it in a podcast. It'll have transcripts, clips, and be a base for everything we create. I think having a theme directory where users can submit their own themes like hot boys, Windows 95, or user-created ones is interesting. We can easily create a directory on git Deno, and people can PR them.\n\n41:29 Guest 3:\nSo, what are you most thrilled about on this new website platform? What's that killer feature each of you is dying to do? I've been itching to build out...\n\n41:46 Wes Bos:\nTranscripts can be automated and interesting, allowing you to line up the TypeScript with playback, highlighting words, and easy sharing. Incorporating AI can generate show notes and bullet points for easy navigation. People can quickly find and jump to specific topics discussed in the show. This makes transcripts and detailed show notes highly valuable.\n\n42:35 Guest 3:\nUC show notes: What a description. Is that what it's called? Juicy show notes? It should be, yeah.\n\n42:44 Scott Tolinski:\nThe line aligns well with their food focus, and I'm excited about the video component. My background is in video, and I want to work with live video, create more live content, and explore deeper functions of live streaming and interactivity. People do amazing things on Twitch with visuals and programmable interfaces. There's a great opportunity for interesting live video. We have lots of content and the capacity to produce different types, so combining them into a complete package is the goal.\n\n43:42 Guest 3:\nResource excites me. I'm curious, have you considered doing a mixed live or not with video and recording for listeners to choose their preferred format? I believe this is a future plan.\n\n44:10 Wes Bos:\nRegarding what we can serve, someone asked if we're doing a video to see the screen while discussing topics. I realized it offers more context than only showing faces. You can still listen to the podcast passively, like during walks or drives. With Spotify allowing easy switches between video and audio, you can briefly watch while out and about before resuming audio-only. So, it's quite interesting. Plus, considering text and other mediums is important too. Overall, exploring various formats can enhance the experience.\n\n45:10 Scott Tolinski:\nmedium. Yep, you're correct. Text, like an ascii 1. A whole stream in ascii. Excited for the podcast on YouTube, having a greater presence there. We barely exist there now. Huge opportunity, giving users visual aspect.\n\n45:32 Wes Bos:\neven if it's just our heads sometimes. I think people enjoy that. Yeah. Because if someone searches for something you explained well, like CSS nesting, you can clip it or send them to an entire show about it. Usually, I search on Google or YouTube for such content and don't necessarily use a podcast search engine. So there's\n\n45:59 Scott Tolinski:\nmassive untapped market. Picture going to your podcast player, typing CSS ESLint—nothing appears. Dumb search. Spotify search is improving. I often search topics and people more now than 6 months ago. Like many, I just can't get on the\n\n46:25 Wes Bos:\nSpotify for podcast train! How was I unaware so long? Gave in & it's great. Pocket Cast does a lot.\n\n46:34 Scott Tolinski:\nnicer aspects regarding podcast-specific functionality for me. It displays podcasts nicely too. I'm just, like, really locked into my podcast setup via Pocket Cast.\n\n46:49 Guest 3:\nI just can't imagine anything amazing enough to pull me away from what I currently use. It's like choosing an RSS reader or a podcast app, you have your preferred flavor. I use Apple Podcasts, and even if it's easy to import episodes into a new app, I'd need to learn and familiarize myself with it. All I really want is to just listen to episodes easily. Plus, it's important to consider my listening history, like which episodes I've already tuned into. So let's discuss\n\n47:18 Wes Bos:\nWe're giving away 600 t-shirts for our 600th episode, featuring cool designs and high quality. Scott is developing a giveaway mechanism, which includes a coupon retrieval system with 600 codes, 50 of which are premium bundles.\n\n47:52 Scott Tolinski:\nThe premium bundles will include a skate deck and a 30-ounce syntax-branded yeti mug, like the one I have on my desk that I love. You've probably seen our Sitac's decks on our socials or Twitter; it's a real, beautiful skate deck. The t-shirt will be a commemorative one, celebrating our partnership and our 600th episode. We'll give out uppercase keycodes with no zeros across various mediums. Some will be in this episode's show notes, where you'll find a URL to claim a keycode. Once locked to you, you can enter your t-shirt size, address, and name. These shirts are free, but limited. If a keycode is locked, try another; we aim to have enough for those who really want one. We'll also have some in our Friday live stream, where we'll discuss more about this.\n\n49:49 Wes Bos:\nat noon eastern, is that good, Scott? Or 1? Let's book it - 9AM Pacific, 10AM Mountain. We'll do a live stream at syntax.fm/live and tweet links. We'll dish out codes and tweet some too. We're figuring out how to distribute the 600 shirts so everyone can get one. We'll do more merch in the future, aiming for break-even pricing instead of charging $36 for a lousy shirt.\n\n50:47 Scott Tolinski:\nWe're not trying to take your money; we just want to make the t-shirt giveaway exciting. It's not solely first come, first serve. Just follow us on Twitter and other platforms we'll post on, and you might grab a code if you haven't yet.\n\n51:15 Wes Bos:\nYou need 1. We'll find creative ways to drop them. Got ideas, like an Easter egg hunt. So just\n\n51:26 Scott Tolinski:\nlook around. Yeah. Yeah. That's I think that's the best way to say it. Yeah.\n\n51:31 Wes Bos:\nI think that's it. Should we get into\n\n51:34 Scott Tolinski:\nsick picks? Let's do it, man. What an episode. Alright. This is a yeah. Tremendous.\n\n51:39 Wes Bos:\nKramer, without preparation, do you have a sick pick for the audience or something you'd like to pick that's sick, since I'm a top of mind person?\n\n51:49 Guest 3:\nYou know, I gotta say, I was reminded of using v-test, or however you pronounce it. It works pretty well, which isn't my experience with much software lately. I built this small app, and I'm not sure if you're in the JES world or one of those 25 other JavaScript realms.\n\n52:09 Scott Tolinski:\nTesting frameworks make life easier. It's great when it works out of the box, right? I was impressed, as coming from Jest or similar, there's no need to learn something new. My expander just worked.\n\n52:23 Wes Bos:\nI'm on sick pickCCSdot com, a skate shop where we got lucky blast and our syntax decks printed. I've wanted to do decks for a while, but always thought low-quality options wouldn't be good. Surprisingly, the decks we got to test are high-quality, just like a normal deck.\n\nIf you want a custom deck, it's about the same cost or less than buying an Android or Element deck, and a great gift. It's at CCS dot com, with a custom deck builder. I asked West if this was his first time hearing about CCS, and he said yes, as he's used to local skate shops in Canada like West 49. CCS seems like a big American skate shop, which is new to me.\n\n53:39 Scott Tolinski:\nThe coolest thing was CCS catalogs, which were thick little books published quarterly. People loved browsing through them, and I even bought my first skate deck from there in eighth grade. I've been a fan for a long time and ordered custom decks too.\n\nNow, let's talk about the comedy podcast, Valley Heat. Season 1 had a great story, but Season 2 only had two episodes then stopped. It was hilarious and features a pathetic guy in his neighborhood dealing with his neighbors' antics. He tries to stay positive and investigates situations while getting walked over by everyone. It has fake ads that are hysterical, and the whole thing is improvised comically. As far as comedy podcasts go, Valley Heat is unique and entertaining. So, check out the 13-episode Season 1 for a short commitment.\n\n55:47 Wes Bos:\nYep, that's all today. Thanks all for tuning in, and to Kramer for joining.
