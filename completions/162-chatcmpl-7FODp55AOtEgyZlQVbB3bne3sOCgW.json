        "content": "\n00:01 Announcer:\nYou're tuning into Syntax, the yummiest web dev podcast! Buckle up with Scott Zelensky & West Bos. Let's go!\n\n00:11 Wes Bos:\nJust in tax podcast: tasty web dev treats! I'm West Boss, full stack dev from Hamilton, Canada, joined by Scott Tolinski from Russia.\n\n00:31 Wes Bos:\nI'm Polish, not Russian, living in Denver. Your guess was close; I can almost see Russia from my backyard.\n\n00:45 Wes Bos:\nToday, we're discussing TypeScript fundamentals, similar to our previous episodes on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript fundamentals. We believe these core skills are essential before exploring frameworks or other areas like canvas, audio, or video. This knowledge helps when job postings require fundamental JavaScript understanding. Our sponsors include Log Rocket and FreshBooks. Scott is managing well despite sleep-deprived dad life, and we're excited about the Level Up redesign.\n\n01:55 Wes Bos:\nLaunched my latest course a few weeks ago, now working on code, recording syntax, and feeling happy. Life's busy with our newborn baby, but all is well.\n\n02:17 Wes Bos:\nWe recently bought a cottage and are prepping for a big move there. Also, I'm launching a new course on JavaScript and TypeScript. I used an outline from the course to plan today's show.\n\n02:43 Wes Bos:\nWell, I think that is going to make it extra special extra extra good. Extra case. Alright.\n\n02:49 Wes Bos:\nLet's dive into Intuit. What's the first JavaScript fundamental?\n\n02:56 Wes Bos:\nFirst, understand JavaScript variables: var, let, and const. Know that const can't be reassigned, while let and var can. There's a preference for const and let nowadays for cleaner code. They differ in how they understand scope, specifically block scope (which beginners may need to learn about first).\n\n04:23 Wes Bos:\nIn my course, we cover VAR, Latin cons, and gotchas, including arrays and objects limitations. We don't cover everything to avoid overwhelming the students. It's crucial to understand Latin cons reassignment, scoping (block and function), and variable lookup in JavaScript.\n\nKnowing scope is important for good code, and not understanding it may lead to errors and potential rewrites. Another key aspect is understanding types, which have seven distinct types in JavaScript, including the new one, symbol. It's essential to know each type and their pros and cons, especially with objects.\n\nUnderstanding how to copy objects and differentiate between reference and copy is crucial, as it prevents accidentally referencing the original object.\n\n07:12 Wes Bos:\nOkay, let's discuss functions, their types, usage, scope, and storage as variables or expressions (e.g., anonymous or named expressions). Know the difference between arrow & non-arrow functions and their scopes. Understand function vs. method (functions within classes) and their distinctions.\n\n08:40 Wes Bos:\nUnderstand scope in various instances, as interview questions often focus on it. Know that JavaScript allows functions to be stored as values, which is the basis for functional programming. Familiarize yourself with the DOM: creating, selecting, modifying, and looping over elements. This knowledge is useful even when using frameworks like React. Learning the DOM and its workings in TypeScript can greatly benefit your overall understanding of how websites operate.\n\n10:22 Wes Bos:\nOften when teaching JavaScript, instructors focus on fundamentals and overlook the importance of the DOM and its interaction with JavaScript. People should spend more time on this, as these skills will always be relevant.\n\n10:49 Wes Bos:\nYou need to memorize Vanilla JavaScript, especially when working on a React app or similar. Focus on adding, adjusting, duplicating, and removing elements, understanding the difference between nodes and elements, and updating basic properties and classes.\n\n11:25 Wes Bos:\nSkills like innertext can reduce errors on your site. If you still face issues, consider our sponsor, Log Rocket. It records sessions, replays bugs, and provides essential information to fix them. Check it out at logrocket.com/syntax. It integrates with everything and saves your bacon, including Canadian bacon.\n\n12:39 Wes Bos:\nThe thing. Is there a movie? There's a movie with John Candy,\n\n12:43 Wes Bos:\nand No, mom. I need a bacon.\n\n12:45 Wes Bos:\nCanadian bacon is different everywhere. In America, it's fried ham, while in the UK, it's a part of the belly and tenderloin, called back bacon, and is cured but not smoked. In Canada, it's called Peameal bacon, made from pork tenderloin, cured and rolled in cornmeal, then thinly sliced and cooked, preferably in a cast iron pan. It's not very common in Canada.\n\n14:19 Wes Bos:\nLearn the essentials of Canadian bacon: Google \"Peameal bacon.\" Unsure about the term? Consider a spelling link in PEAMEALPEL.\n\n14:37 Wes Bos:\nBacon's great; try peameal on a bun from Toronto's farmer's market. Anyway, back to JavaScript after discussing Canadian bacon.\n\n14:58 Wes Bos:\nWell, understanding prototypes and this in JavaScript might not be difficult for some, but for others, it can be confusing due to different programming backgrounds. This refers to the current scope in the application. If you're unsure about what this is, you can use a debugger or console log to check its value. It's important to figure it out, as this plays an essential role in the language.\n\n16:10 Wes Bos:\nDiscussing \"this\" is tricky, like mentioning Amazon's assistant. To determine \"this\" in a function, examine the method call, where it refers to the object on which the method was called, typically an instance of a class, a React component, or the window. The confusion arises when learning prototypes too soon, and many developers don't actually use \"this.\" It was commonly used for event listeners; however, with arrow functions, e.target and e.currentTarget, plus React hooks, the need for \"this\" has reduced. Regardless, it's important to understand its role in object-oriented programming and ES6 class creation since it's a common interview question.\n\n18:11 Wes Bos:\nIf you struggle with understanding this topic, try finding a site with various scenarios to help you comprehend it better. You can build a scenario using Vercel and JavaScript, then observe patterns and usage in ESLint. Spend time learning about it as it's often an interview question. It's essential to understand prototypes and their relationships with functions and classes. Create a tool to help grasp these concepts.\n\n19:17 Wes Bos:\nBuild a website showcasing 10 examples of different JavaScript instances, like event listeners and arrow functions, for your resume. Though this.dev domain is taken, find a catchy name. As a hiring manager, seeing a portfolio with a site explaining JavaScript's \"this\" would be impressive.\n\n19:58 Wes Bos:\nI understood this, tackled it, and shared the wealth with others. If asked, I can explain it and even teach it, which is valuable. Next, we want to discuss events, a big topic alongside the dumb. Many resources use events impractically, but understanding events in real-world use, like handling form submissions, is crucial to cover foundational bases.\n\n20:45 Wes Bos:\nYep, listen for button clicks, all 4 mouse events, and 9 pointer events that combine touch & mouse. Understand how bubbling and propagation work.\n\n21:09 Wes Bos:\nmean? Bubbling. I think we should definitely\n\n21:12 Wes Bos:\nLet's do an episode on bubbling and propagation. Understanding how and why they work is important. Dispatching your own events might seem advanced, but it helps grasp event handling. You can dispatch custom events and pass data between event handlers. Custom events are useful for building components.\n\n21:56 Wes Bos:\nWord. Understanding arrays is crucial for TypeScript, including manipulation and methods like push, splice, etc. Comprehending spreading, resting, and common methods (forEach, map, filter, reduce) is vital. Check out our popular syntax episode on array methods if you aren't familiar. Know when to use arrays vs. objects or when to modify an array vs creating a new one. Consider mutation vs. immutability not only in arrays but overall in JavaScript.\n\n23:45 Wes Bos:\nCan they mutate? Yes. Are they changeable arrays? Yes, much nicer than mutations. Some array methods like Pnpm alter the original array, while others like slice or splice return a new one. There's a trend for immutability, using methods that return new arrays instead of modifying existing ones. However, this can be annoying as it involves reassigning variables.\n\n24:29 Wes Bos:\nI do. I do that. I I typically keep things immutable,\n\n24:32 Wes Bos:\nBut 99% of the time, I do, especially with functions and arrays. It's about reference vs. copy. Spend time understanding these, not needing to be an expert, but recognizing potential bugs. Know what mutating an array does for interviews and preventing issues.\n\n25:11 Wes Bos:\nCheck out Freshbooks to keep track of invoices, clients, and payments for your freelance work. Our sponsor West Bos highlights how Freshbooks can help with managing these tasks while learning JavaScript.\n\n25:44 Wes Bos:\nAs a web developer, don't spend too much time on taxes, invoices, expenses, and time tracking. Use Freshbooks for cloud accounting at freshbooks.com/syntax for a 30-day free trial. \n\nFlow control involves doing things in different orders or when conditional. This relates to looping, which has various types like 'for of' loop, 'for in' loop, and array loops (e.g., forEach, map, reduce). Understand how they work and when to use them. While usually advisable to use array methods, there are cases where 'for of' loop is useful, such as running an array of promises in sequence. You can await inside a 'for of' loop, which pauses the process until the promise resolves. Besides looping, flow control also includes if statements.\n\n27:52 Wes Bos:\nKnow about truthy and falsy? They seem like a couple gardening down the road. Understanding them helps with efficient, readable if statements. People often overcomplicate with if-else, switches, or ternary when a simple if works. Writing clean code is crucial, and I have a resource later to assist with that.\n\n28:49 Wes Bos:\nYeah, good point. We've got promises and async/await here, relating to Ajax calls and flow control when dealing with time-consuming tasks. Asynchronous understanding is crucial, especially when transitioning from synchronous languages like Pnpm to JavaScript, where async is the norm.\n\n29:31 Wes Bos:\nMany of our syntax episodes cover the topics mentioned, so check them out for more in-depth discussions. Security and accessibility, like XSS (cross-site scripting), are important to understand how domains communicate and set rules for accessing information. This knowledge is essential for your own security and navigating errors while following tutorials or working on your own projects.\n\n30:29 Wes Bos:\nYou need to understand APIs, request headers, and responses. Be aware of potential XSS issues when using HTML from external sources. Know a few basics about accessibility to avoid making your site inaccessible for some users, like ensuring elements can be accessed via keyboard. We have shows explaining these topics in detail, so you don't need to be an expert, just aware.\n\n31:43 Wes Bos:\nBe considerate to your website visitors. Accessibility is crucial in every aspect, so have a strong foundation. Immutability is important as well. Understand modules, but don't stress mastery. With front-end frameworks, grasp basic import/export and named imports/exports, but not every detail. Know the difference between named and default.\n\n32:42 Wes Bos:\nModules have their own scope for sharing data between them. Closures are often asked in interviews, and are related to immutability. It involves a function with a mysterious space containing variables even after it returns. There are simple examples and resources online to learn closures. Knowing their purpose and usefulness is essential, but you don't need to code everything with closures.\n\n33:35 Wes Bos:\nIndeed, it's amusing how Ajax requests are still mentioned in 2019, as they were a Dreamweaver thing. We should call them just requests now, as they involve fetching data from third party sources, parsing it (using JSON or GraphQL), and utilizing it for various purposes. It's a vital foundation to comprehend.\n\n34:33 Wes Bos:\nSynchronous XML HTTP requests are outdated; now it's all asynchronous. Chrome warns of its removal. JSON, a text-based JavaScript object, is popular for easy data transport.\n\n35:01 Wes Bos:\nAfter recording this episode, we might realize we missed some foundational aspects. If so, tweet us, and we'll retweet as our apology. One thing that improved my TypeScript skills is understanding clean code. I've linked a clean code GitHub repo based on Robert Martin's book, adapted to JavaScript. It shows good and bad examples in a concise way, which helps understand foundational concepts and avoid mistakes. Adhering to such standards makes it easier to grasp how things work. I highly recommend spending time going through these, as it can improve your understanding.\n\n36:28 Wes Bos:\nGreat read with bad/good examples, making things clear. If needing over 2 arguments, it shows how to use an object as an argument.\n\n36:48 Wes Bos:\nYep, love it. Functions should do 1 thing. Big fan, gonna read it all. Better JavaScript course is this repo adapted. Awesome, that's what we do. Available.\n\n37:04 Wes Bos:\nVercel up tutorials dot com forward slash -- Whoa. -- store? Pro.\n\n37:08 Wes Bos:\nThe store has transitioned but still exists. A \"store\" link leads to the tutorial listing page with buy now buttons. It used to be a separate section on leveluptutorials.com with its own code, but now it's just a component toggled by a route.\n\n37:42 Wes Bos:\nAlright, it may be overwhelming that an hour's worth of fundamentals covers just the basics, without diving into frameworks. However, mastering this could take a couple of weeks, and once you start building real projects, those concepts will solidify.\n\n38:18 Wes Bos:\nDefinitely, cement is key for a strong foundation. My top pick today is the Code Newby podcast, Bosc s. It covers computer science topics in short, around 20-minute episodes. Examples include a beginner-friendly breakdown of binary and bytes, big o notation, and real-life examples of stacks and trees. The hosts explain these concepts brilliantly.\n\n39:58 Wes Bos:\nLove this podcast! My sick pick is the Owlette sock. New parents always check if their baby's chest is moving to ensure they're breathing. When babies sleep, their breathing is light, causing parents to poke them.\n\n40:28 Wes Bos:\nEnsure they're awake but not disturb their sleep. Unsure, I check their breathing, but accidentally wake them up. Oops, my mistake.\n\n40:39 Wes Bos:\nThe worst part for parents is the constant worry and crying. We bought an Owlette smart sock for our last kid, which tracks heart rate and oxygen levels like a hospital clip. It's a sock you put on the child's foot, and an app transmits the data. It alerts you if it falls off or there's an issue. It once alerted us, not sure if false alarm, but grateful. The new one does sleep tracking and shows when they're awake or asleep based on wiggling. It's expensive ($300) but worth it for sleep, and you can just sell it afterwards.\n\n42:15 Wes Bos:\nIn 6 months, kid stuff turns over quickly, and Facebook groups for selling it are amazing. Most of the stuff we got was borrowed or bought from others. Check out West boss dot com forward slash courses for my courses on ES6, node, React, or CSSgrid. Some are free, some are paid.\n\nWe both teach web development stuff and work on new series. Last month was real-world debugging and dev tools, and this month's course is ecommerce with Gatsby at level up tutorials dot com forward slash pro, available on July 31st. Catch up on Gatsby with pro Gatsby2 as well. Thanks for tuning in, and see you on Monday.\n\n43:54 Wes Bos:\nPeace.\n\n43:57 Wes Bos:\nVisit syntax.fm for show archives. Subscribe in your podcast player and leave a review if you enjoy it.\n\n44:19 Wes Bos:\nMy name is West. My dog eats food on the moon.\n\n44:25 Wes Bos:\nMy name is Scott.Please buy some purple cheese before meeting my brother.\n"
