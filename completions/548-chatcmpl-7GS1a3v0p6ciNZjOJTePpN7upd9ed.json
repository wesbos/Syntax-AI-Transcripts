The HastyEST, craziest, tastiest web development treats. Coming in hot, here's West Barracuda, bars, and Tero Loco Tolinski.\n\n00:27 Scott Tolinski:\nOh, welcome to Syntax on this Monday hasty treat. We'll be discussing a fantastic topic today - rendering methods explained, based on the various methods listed in the State of JS survey. This unique list caught our attention, making it perfect to dive in, define the different rendering methods, and highlight their unique aspects. There's an astonishing variety! I'm Scott Tolinski, a developer from Denver, and as always, I'm accompanied by West Balls.\n\n01:06 Wes Bos:\nMister rendering himself, they called me in high school. They did. Yeah.\n\n01:11 Scott Tolinski:\nLikely to render. I guess it works in cooking too. I recall setting my computer to render 3D video scenes overnight, hoping it wouldn't stop before my exam with the 3D modeling project. Man, I wonder if\n\n01:35 Wes Bos:\nHow much faster things are these days, especially with my video rendering improvements. However, we're discussing hURL rendering, which involves getting HTML to browsers. There are numerous ways to do this, as in most cases, code like PHP, Ruby on Rails, React, Svelte, or TypeScript frameworks generate the HTML. It may need to be rendered on the server or in the browser or even be rehydrated. So we'll discuss the big four and then touch on others from this extensive list.\n\n02:26 Scott Tolinski:\nHey, before diving into those, let's discuss two essential services for any rendering: error and exception handling like Century, and content management like sanity. Our sponsors in the house, Century and sanity, help you monitor your website's performance and manage content efficiently.\n\nCentury, the perfect place to track errors and exceptions, also offers node profiling to identify slow-to-execute functions and improve your application's speed. Setting up is a breeze; install the package, initialize, and integrate it into your Century install to enable node profiling.\n\nAdditionally, Century provides UI performance tracking to monitor route speeds, making your website more user-friendly. Plus, you'll have access to user feedback alerts, custom dashboards, and a comprehensive list of your website's errors and exceptions. Just head to century.io and use the coupon code 'tasty treat'.\n\n03:58 Wes Bos:\nand get 2 months free. Sponsored by Sanity, the content platform, they recently rolled out a new version of Sanity Studio, their real-time React-based CMS with custom workflows, enabling tracking of edits and more. Just days ago, they had Sanity Product Day where the new Sanity Studio was launched. I encourage you to explore the videos, docs, and features surrounding this launch, especially if you're a React dev. Visit sanity.io/syntax for double the free usage tier, or sanity.io/productday (if available) for more information.\n\n05:04 Scott Tolinski:\nThe show notes include links to the new Sanity Studio, which is pretty cool. Thanks to Sandy for sponsoring. So, I was taking the State of JavaScript survey, as one does, and I saw this application patterns section with different rendering methods. I thought this was a well-organized list of them. Let's go through these rendering options for rendering your HTML and their use cases.\n\nFirst is the Single Page Application (SPA), also known as client-side rendering (CSR). It's for applications built in JavaScript running entirely in the browser. This type of application doesn't require server-side TypeScript or HTML to function. Typically, you load up React or any front-end framework at an entry point, and it populates the DOM for the browser to understand. However, it doesn't populate actual server-side HTML. When you inspect these websites, there's not much in the body or maybe just a shell, but everything is done with client-side TypeScript, hitting APIs, pulling data, and rendering it. SPAs provide flexibility with fewer headaches compared to server-side rendering and hydration but may have speed performance and SEO disadvantages.\n\n07:36 Wes Bos:\nPotentially SEO stuff too. Next, we have the multi-page application (MPA), an app that runs primarily on a server with minimal client-side dynamic behavior. It's funny, this type of app was huge about 4-5 years ago, just as the first one was 3 years ago. They're still big, but not as much as before.\n\nMPAs are like WordPress websites where you go from page to page with PHP rendering on the server, outputting HTML to the client-side. It says minimal client-side dynamic behavior, so I'm unsure if it includes JavaScript sprinkles frameworks. Nonetheless, it's server-rendered HTML, and when you submit a form, you get new HTML on the client-side.\n\n08:49 Scott Tolinski:\nYeah, some people might question the difference between this and, for instance, an SSR setup of a React app, but the main distinction is the minimal client-side JavaScript without a hydration process. The client-side JS is often done through something like jQuery or small one-off tasks.\n\nNext, we have SSG or static site generation - this typically involves writing your applications in JavaScript or maybe templating languages and running it through a process that outputs static HTML. This transforms the app into somewhat of a multi-page application because you have an HTML file for each page. However, usually, there is the dynamic step of both hydrating your code and sending HTML, followed by loading interactivity with JavaScript commonly executed through a framework like React or Vue.\n\nWith static site generation, you're shipping your hard HTML and gaining the benefits of client-side rendering along with the interactivity provided by a React setup. The biggest difference between static site generation and a multi-page application is that there's generally no server involved.\n\n10:46 Wes Bos:\nWith static site generation, everything is done at build time on a server. The server generates it without needing to update the number of items on each page refresh. At that point, it's HTML. To make changes to any page, you can either do it client-side and update once it's loaded or regenerate that specific page and redeploy it. Totally.\n\n11:14 Scott Tolinski:\nNext up is SSR or server-side rendered, and an SSR site can differ because in their definition described here, it is basically a site with a hydration step. You know, typically, you're using a backend framework to generate the HTML on each request. Instead of the HTML being generated ahead of time, every time a request comes in, you are generating or serving cached HTML, then sending it along. There is usually a hydration step where the framework acclimates to the static HTML, making it client-side from that point forward where you get client-side rendering and such as well.\n \nSo, SSR sites can see performance and SEO benefits because, like a static site, when robots or spiders crawl the website, they see plain HTML, allowing them to parse without waiting for APIs to resolve. This eliminates the need for client-side crawlers, which in my experience, haven't been great. Having straight-up HTML also gives access to server-side caching, which is one of the greatest benefits. You can make it fully dynamic while caching heavily to make it fast. One of the biggest advantages is that you can use a CDN or set caching headers to cache your user's browser.\n\n13:06 Wes Bos:\nSome big benefits there. So, those are, like, the big 4, and maybe this next one is also pretty big. Partial hydration is starting to become much bigger, which involves only hydrating some of your components on the client. Not every component needs to be rendered in React. Your navigation, even though templated out in React, may have no dynamism, so you don't need React running on that. Regular HTML and CSS might be fine, but you have another component, like a contact form or a buy button, that requires updates. That's where things like rack server components are popular for partial hydration. You can opt into rendering on the server or updating on the client.\n\n14:04 Scott Tolinski:\nYeah, the next one listed is progressive hydration. I haven't used anything like that, but the concept involves controlling the order of component hydration on the client-side. You serve up HTML, and the components may or may not need quick access in a JavaScript context. So, you prioritize the elements to hydrate first, making the most interactive elements available sooner.\n\nI'm not sure I understand that one. In a web app with a hydration step, the whole page or data must be hydrated to become interactive. The big criticism of hydration is the latency between its start and when users can interact with the page, affecting the time to interactive. Progressive hydration lets you hydrate specific site aspects based on their priority, effectively decreasing the overall latency.\n\n15:40 Wes Bos:\ntime to interactive. The next one is ESLint architecture: isolated islands of dynamic behavior and multiple entry points in otherwise\n\n15:49 Scott Tolinski:\na static site like Astro and 11ty are examples of this. Okay, so entry points in a web app or a framework app usually occur when attaching React to the DOM. That's an entry point, like React rendering an element on a div or islands of React. So with Astro, you have individual points that become interactive and serve as separate React apps instead of a single large one with a giant div. Makes sense, right?\n\nNext up is progressive enhancement. I don't fully understand its connection here, but it's about ensuring your app works without JavaScript, meaning it functions without TypeScript. This could be considered a multi-page application since you're just loading up new pages, but it's important to note it operates without JavaScript. New tools like Remix or SvelteKit prioritize progressive enhancement, which was somewhat neglected before. Although it's true that almost everyone uses JavaScript, it's nice when a website works without it too, or at least uses it minimally.\n\n17:48 Scott Tolinski:\nsome form data or JSON, it works perfectly. So, I'm genuinely excited to see these frameworks. We've learned from history. If you remove one member of ESLint 182, it's not Blink 182 anymore. It doesn't work as well. If you remove one of the 3 core members of the web, like TypeScript, people will talk bad. But I'm sure they did about Tom De Long as well. And where did he go? He's gone.\n\n18:20 Wes Bos:\nNext 1 is ISG, or incremental static generation, which allows you to dynamically update or modify a static site even after the initial build. This makes a lot of sense. Gatsby does this now, while Next JS doesn't. Essentially, it’s what the Syntax website does. When you visit the Syntax site, it regenerates the page in the background for the next visitor. The next person gets the static version, but then it's regenerated again for the following visitor. This is great because it provides the benefits of static without doing everything at build time. Instead, it's done incrementally.\n\n19:01 Scott Tolinski:\nThat's why it's in the name. A lot of these are named well. Some get tricky when discussing topics like islands, architecture, since understanding concepts and pros/cons is needed. Next is streaming SSR, which is intriguing. Instead of sending HTML down the ESLint, server-rendered content is broken into smaller streamed chunks ESLintstreaming. It seems like a Vercel method for improved performance, but also risky in terms of errors. SSR and hydration aren't enjoyable, so it'll be interesting to see if more streaming SSR setups become the norm for SSR. Next topic is Resumability.\n\n19:56 Wes Bos:\nSerialize the framework state on the server, allowing the client to pick it up without duplicating code execution. This is seen in Instagram and TikTok, where a big object is dumped into the HTML to provide initial state. This strategy avoids slow load and fetch times by directly providing initial data to a Redux store or another state management system on the client side. This popular technique allows for efficient resumption for platforms like QUIC.\n\n20:54 Scott Tolinski:\nOh, really? Yeah, we discussed this in the quick episode. I believe you're referring to data resumability, which people do. The idea here is not needing a hydration step for your application to function TypeScript-wise after sending SSR to HTML. It's a nuanced concept that we've talked about before. Essentially, you're sending HTML with JavaScript that works immediately instead of requiring a hydration step to reconnect everything to the client-side framework version.\n\n21:38 Wes Bos:\nOh, I remember this. Okay. That's pretty cool as well.\n\n21:41 Scott Tolinski:\nYeah, it's cool and a great idea, but kinda hard to grasp when thinking about everything. Maybe consider edge rendering. I don't really know much about it, but edge rendering is\n\n21:55 Wes Bos:\nI was showing Scott before the show how altering rendered HTML at the edge before sending it to the client works. This is either intercepting existing HTML and rendering it or rendering it right at the edge, like Denodeploy does. They render the HTML for your request at the server closest to your house, making it as fast as possible. I demonstrated the speed to Scott by committing and refreshing, and it was impressively quick. However, there was a moment where it didn't work initially, since I forgot to push the commit. After realizing the mistake, the process was a pleasant and fast experience.\n\n23:09 Scott Tolinski:\nI love it. It's like it is the quintessential\n\n23:11 Wes Bos:\nweb demo? One thing missing from this list is Alpine, JS, Stimulus, Livewire, rendering HTML in a templating language, and adding JavaScript sprinkles with Alpine, Stimulus, Livewire, Hotwire, or even just jQuery or vanilla JS. That's Multi-Page Applications (MPA) with minimal client-side dynamic behavior. It might also be considered \"Islands\" or Progressive Enhancement. I'd call that an MPA since that's how we built them for a decade before all these acronyms appeared. We'd render HTML, add JavaScript for interactivity, and call it a day. Can I just get a regular website here? Yeah, like a coffee-flavored one.\n\n24:21 Scott Tolinski:\nflavored website, please.\n\n24:26 Wes Bos:\nI think we should have Kaleb from Alpine JS on, as it's quite interesting. There's something happening now since we have an entire episode with 15 different ways to render your application. We are going to discuss some good methods, as things are changing. Remix is gaining popularity, as well as React server components, with people swinging back to the server side significantly.\n\n25:00 Scott Tolinski:\nMhmm. JavaScript sprinkles are gaining popularity. There's a lot to it, and it's funny because there are specific instances where a SPA would be the most useful. But everyone went so hard into SPA land that it was seen as a good technique for any website, not just specific types. I remember in the meteor scene, the recommended router switched from server-side to client-side, and I didn't understand why that became the thing. We stopped thinking about the server and focused on the client, making SPAs the go-to. But SPAs are still valid; you just need to consider the goals, target audience, and purpose of the website before deciding on the approach.\n\n26:13 Wes Bos:\nIt feels like there are 15 distinct ones - the spa is interesting since people often say they're just building a spa, not needing SEO, server rendering, or any of that stuff. If you were creating a Vercel tool, would you still go spa, skipping the server dance? I'm unsure, as getting data from the\n\n26:35 Scott Tolinski:\nThe API to the website is still a pain, as you're doing straight up fetch calls, unlike integrated frameworks like remix and Falcon which make it easier to get data into the component. Although I wouldn't prefer fetch calls in my application today, working in a SPA has speed benefits compared to server-side frameworks with exceptions and rehydration issues. There can also be complications with server-side web applications, such as rendering web components and needing to reinitialize them, making it more difficult for certain advantages.\n\n27:43 Wes Bos:\nBut if you need those benefits, choose something that makes it possible. Awesome. That's it for rendering. Share your thoughts on rendering's state. Tweet us at syntax f m. We'd love to hear your opinions. Absolutely.\n\n27:58 Scott Tolinski:\nCool. We will catch you on Wednesday.\n\n28:00 Wes Bos:\nPeace.\n\n28:04 Scott Tolinski:\nHey, visit syntax.fm for our show archive.
