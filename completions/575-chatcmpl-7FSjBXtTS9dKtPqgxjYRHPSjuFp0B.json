With JavaScript, CSS, node modules, barbecue tips, get workflows, breakdancing,soft skills, web development, the hastyest,the craziest, the tape wept developmenttreats. Coming in hot. Here is west. Barracuda,Bos, and Scott El Doro Loco.Totally ski.\n\n00:29 Scott Tolinski:\nOh. Welcome to syntax.In today'sMonday hasty treat we're gonna be talkingabout config files, how much welove them, how many of them there are. I mean, we must love them because we have tons and tons of them. So My name is Scott Tolinski. I'm a developer from Denver. With me as always is West Bos, West. What's up? How's your config files looking? How's your the root of your project? Is it full of full of files. Root of my project is is looking good. I I this sort of stumbled up I stumbled upon 1 the other day that has 30 config files in it. And, like, I I just screenshotted it, and I was like, I think that's a record for me.\n\n01:07 Wes Bos:\nAnd there were response to it was really interesting. There was a lot of people that were, like,modern web development, LOL,garbage, and even though, like, half of them weren't related tofront end development at all.And, like, the other thing is it's like,we kinda need them, you know. Like, I don't like it either. It's so obnoxious that you're like, a root of your Git repo is full of a million different files and whatnot. So we're here to sort of help you save yourself from config file helland and figure out how do wehow do we make this manageable both in local dev as well as, like, some ideas about like, I think node has kinda failed this year. So we'll we'll get into that as well. Yeah. Totally. How you doing? You just got back from ski and I heard? Yeah. Yeah. I got I was telling you I got the classic\n\n01:57 Scott Tolinski:\nski tan where my the tip of my nose is bright red, like the lower half of my jaw is all sunburned because I didn't wear sunscreen in before for some reason, I typically do, butI took Landon out there and we we drove out, left it early, early, early, and then just sat in traffic for, like, 3 hours on the way home. And, like, when you have AA5 year old in the car for that long, especially if they just got done skiing, it was like,How about you just take a nap as long as possibleand then hopefully you won't have to go pee at some point in this drive because I'm not gonna get out off the highway here. Oh, no. Luckily it was all good. Yeah. That's good. What how was your electric car up to the mountains? Dude, let me tell you. So the first time that I've done a ski trip in my carby myself with Landon. I mean, we've done I've driven into the mountains where we stayed there and charged it. So I wasn't quite sure what to expect. We went to maybe 1 of the closer mountains to us and, you know, hour and a halfdrive without traffic, hour 15, something like that. And On the way there, the car got all the way down to50 percent, 45 Vercel.And I was thinking, okay,that seems pretty fine, but it's mostly uphill. Right? You're gaining a ton of elevation. You're gaining, like,8000 feet of elevation. Soon the way home,Iwas surprised to see that an hour into the drive I had gained3 percent on my batterybecause of all the the the amount that the engine's having to limit you from the amount of you want to gain from going downhill.I I looked looked at I left and I had, like, 98 miles till empty or something when we left the house. And then when Iyou know, an hour later, I look at it. It's like, you are now a hundred and 3 milesto to Lettie. It's like, this is awesome. IIIgot home and I I still had, like, 80 miles till empty. So it's like the entire drive home\n\n03:53 Wes Bos:\nbarely took any of the battery just because of reach It was pretty incredible actually. Wow. That's really cool. So, like, you can almost spend your whole battery going up the mountain.And they just hope.Yeah. Right. Yeah. Gotta go there. That's good. We have we have a massivehill here too. Like Hamilton has split to down the mountain, which is downtown and up the mountain. And whenever we go down it, I'm always thinking, like, I wonder Iwonder how muchI always tell my wife, she's like, don't speed down the mountain. And I I used to never hit my brakes going down because I was like, this is free. Like, I'm not spending anything to go and then I got a ticket. I got a ticket. So\n\n04:29 Scott Tolinski:\nflying down the yeah. On that same regard, there's some there's some spots in the drive into the Rocky Mountains West that are, like,a couple of minutes of just really steep downwards, and they'll they'll have pull offs for trucks whose brakes go out and stuff like that. And it's sointense if you don't know what you're doing because you can you can go from 50 miles per hour to a hundred miles per hour without even thinking about it you gotta, like, ride ride the breaker. That's why driving a manual is really good because you could just keep it in a lower gear and have the engine help you a bit. But okay. Config file. Sorry.\n\n05:03 Wes Bos:\nAlright. So we need config files. Config files are used for configuringyour dev tooling ESLint prettier VS code, your build tooling, TypeScript, Babbel, SWBC,your infrastructure.This is this is 1 thing that I I really like is that a lot of times the config files are your infrastructure,meaning that you're describing what you're hostingand integrations and domain names, you're describing what all that stuff is as code.And rather than you having to, like, log in to something and remember what buttons to press,is you just make a config file. And and as much as people don't like config files, I'd much rather havethe entireAWS infrastructureconfigured in a single file rather than having to\n\n05:52 Scott Tolinski:\nremember which and suppress and and whatnot because there's no way you're gonna be able to set that up again perfectly a second time. Mhmm. What other kinds get there's ignore files, NPM ignore, get ignore, repo details, contributing, etcetera, etcetera. There's a million of them. Yeah. All all these things could be just filling the root of your your project, which is funny because you think the root of your project isn't even the source, but it tells so much about the application, right? It tells so much, like you said, being able to reproducethe sameconfig across environments is really where these things shine and help you. And they also just make life easier. I think the my my big critique with config files in general ishow many different formats we have. Right? I have a config dot JSON for Cypress. I have a config dot j s for post CSS.I have a config dot j s for Svelte and Veet,JSON config for TS,NPMRCas this is kind of its own thing. Right? It'sjust what what what even, you know, those files that are, like, an ENV file or Pnpm? Is that a specific format that, you know, where it's just, like, key value pairs? Is there a name for that?\n\n07:04 Wes Bos:\nThat's a good question becauseyou think about, like, the prettier RC,and that is just JSON. But then you think aboutwhat other what else is there? Like a abash RC, and that is bash. So I I think, like, what a specific RC file is is not a specific type. So it's usually the, like, simple, like, key value pair. I think that's just, like,bash syntaxor key value syntax? I'm not sure exactly what it is. I didn't know if it had a name. But\n\n07:36 Scott Tolinski:\nthat to me is 1 of the bigger pinpoints when you think about config files. Right? It just everybody kind of picks their own format and does it the way they want to do it. Yeah. It's really frustrating to have to go between them.\n\n07:50 Wes Bos:\nI love I think my favorite is probably just straight up JavaScript to config files because -- Yeah. -- sometimes you canactually write JavaScript in them.A lot of places don't want you to do that because your config file should be staticand not computed.But it's it's kind of nice to be able to like, I have a VIT config file. Andwhen I run my VIT,server,I automatically open up for specifically for my hot tips. I automaticallyopen up the last edited HTML file in my Vit server,and it's so handy because if I've got200 different index dot HTML folders, all kinds of stuff, and rather than having to find the 1 that I'm working on at the moment, it just automatically opens it up and says, oh, you changed this 1 last, open it up. I just wrote, like, a little bit code that looked at the file system and and sorted by\n\n08:43 Scott Tolinski:\nlast can you share that by the way? Just throw that in the shots or something. I I'll have something that I can share too. We can do a little swap. I have something neat in my feed config using JavaScript. I use the define propertyand I define a global variable named Vercel, and that version is equal to a JSON stringifyprocess dot envNpm package version. So it's grabbingthe package version and writing it to a variable named version that I can then use withinall sorts of things. Right? Whether that's Century for error tracking. Right? I throw that in there and then Century always knows what version I have as long as it's up to date in package dot JSON. Super handy. Oh, that's great. I I do something similar like that in the Bos monster. And I I just pulled pulled that data from the package JSON, but doing it at a viet\n\n09:31 Wes Bos:\nlevel is is super handy. I just posted the link in the show notes for the the viet 1 as well. It's it's probably not all that helpful for people that are running, like, React apps or whatever. But if you have, like, a folder where you're always fussing and, like, that's your folder for doing demos and whatnot, it's really really handy. But also, you know, just the just like what you're talking about, have being able to write JavaScript in these things, you know, doesn't have to be complex to be useful. Like, these are just nice little niceties.Exactly.Other things we have they're in Yamal, TOMal,a whole bunch of different thingsout there. And they can also go in your package dot JSON as well.II like putting them in package JSON because it's just 1 less file to do. But often I find myself being like, ugh. The freaking I hate writing JSON as well. Like, you have to double quote it There can't do comments.Thankfully, a lot of the config files that are in JSONare JSON 5. Which means that you can have trailing comma. You can put comments in there. You can do all kinds of stuff like that, which is nice. So for very simple stuff, I'll throw it in my package JSON. Otherwise, I have to go ahead and create a new file for it. I almost never put it in package dot JSON even though I think that that would be the most ideal scenario.\n\n10:47 Scott Tolinski:\nBecauseI personally would love to scoop up all of myI would love to scoop up all of myconfigs and put them into package dot JSON, which is kind of like your apps config in the first place.But like you said, no comments, DenoJavaScript in there.The no comments thing is that is kind of a big deal. Again, the for the format just kind of stinks in general compared to what you get elsewhere with you said JSON 5 orJavaScript or even, you know, Yamal. Yeah. Totally.\n\n11:18 Wes Bos:\nSo I I feel like I'll say this here. I feel like node or an and or Npm has has kinda failed us here in thatLike, people were talking, like, we need a standardfor config files. And config files need you need to be able to define a config You need to be able to define them in different formats. You wanna do it in in import syntax. You wanna do it in common JS. You wanna do it in TypeScript.You need to be able to extend configs. Like, in e s lint, you need to be able to, like, tick a base and then extend off of that. You need to be able to, like, deep merge configs. If if you want to do that type of thing, you wanna be able to publish your config.And, like, wouldn't it be nice? Because, like,I don't know, 90 percent of the configs that are in my folder are NPMor tooling related that is in NPM.Like, wouldn't it be nice if they stepped up and said, like, here's the standard.We developed this amazing config. Apparently, Python has something similar to this. But, like, wouldn't it be nice if they did that and then there's a standardtype of config that we can go forward?\n\n12:23 Scott Tolinski:\nYeah. And, actually, you know, it's funny because when we When we talked about this or when when you first mentioned this as an idea or you were on Twitter, I I remembereda Twitter thread where where Kent C Dodd was talking about this last year. And I actually just Googled Ken C Dodd's config folder in found the Twitter thread, and it was really pretty interesting becausethere's a lot of a lot of comments in here aboutprosand cons and stuff that I didn't necessarily had thought of when thinking about this, but there's a lot of, like, educated,educated discussion around the idea of a config folder. So It might be interesting to p author if if you're the type of person who's interested in this. Totally. But III agree. Yeah. And and then there could be a situation where you have that whole xKCD comment their comic thing about a standard and,\n\n13:11 Wes Bos:\nyou know, how Then you have to do It's true. And people are like, oh, well, I don't I don't like that standard or, like, there's so many edge cases. Like, you need some config based on your environment, but then other configs are across all the environments, you know, and then you have to People and then people will build an abstraction on top of it that are based on file names andI don't know the answer to it. And I that's probably why no 1 has really tackled it.Just yet. But there is so there is 1 thing called Cosmic Config. And this is a package for tool authorsto load in configs. And what it will do isyour the people who are using your configs can put it in you can put it in your package JSON. You can make a JSON or a YamL RC file.Or I guess that's what the that other 1 is. It's probably YamL.Which is when it's not JSON, it's Yamal,you can also and this is the big 1 is put them inside a Config directory, and that's that's probably the big 1 here is that a lot of these tools allowand support youputting those config files in a dot config folderand putting those and that just cleans up the root of your your repo a lot. It makes things a little bit overwhelming. Because I don't know. Sometimes I just do a quick scan of a a repo and I'm like, okay. Where's the code to do this? Mhmm. And then you're just like, oh my goodness. There's like,40 folders in there, and you don't even know where to look. And actually, I was here, audience, tell us if you think this would be an interesting show, is Like, wouldn't it be cool if we wrote a script to grab8000 repo's and then saw what the most commondirectories were, and then we go through and explain what those directories are. Like, what's a Lib folder? Why what's a source folder? Mhmm. You know? Yeah. Totally. The Cosmic ConfigFig folder, the dot config is pretty well supported. TypeScript uses it, prettier uses it, jest, ESLint, babble.That is really nice. The Webpack don't use it. However, a lot of these tools willallow you to pass in the location of your config file as, like, an argument or something like that when you are running it. I'm not a huge fan of that because I do like that. It just picks it up without having to have a bunch of stuffin youryour TypeScript.But you can I I think you could probably get pretty far, maybe 90, 95 percent, putting it all in the config folder?And having everything work. It's just 1 of those things where once it's working, it's hard to\n\n15:42 Scott Tolinski:\nmove those things around. So just to confirm, just just plain English wise.If 1 of these things that do support cosmic config, TypeScript prettier jest, ESLint pebble, means that out of the box, you can throw them into a config folder without having any words. And and to be clear, that is a dot config folder. Right? Yeah. Dot config forward slash t s config forward slash dot prettier r c forward slash e s lint r c All those good things. You can just toss that t s config in a dot config folder right now. I didn't know that TypeScript allowed it. Yeah. Yeah. And it will find it. That's interesting to me. Because it seems like somebody's gotta bite the bullet and just start putting stuff in a config folder and then Yeah.\n\n16:23 Wes Bos:\nYou know? I I like it becausea lot of like desktop tools will also allow it forthe root. You know, like, if you go to Tilda in your machine, you've got 400 dot files. You can almost always put those in a dot config file folder as well, and that really cleans up your your local machines for a directory.Yeah. You're right. What else do we have here? So this is something that just was released in VS code, like, a week or 2 ago, and it's this new thing calledfile nestingwhere Oh, those have been in for a bit. I'm sorry. That's it really? Yeah. Because I've been using it for over a year. So Oh, man. I must have I totally miss this then. Okay. So what it does is it allows you in your VS code to specifyfile types with another file. And and 1 common use for this is you can take all your configs and just put it underyour package JSON.And there is a nested config.You have to do it all yourself. Like, there's no good default, but there ain't Fu. Has put out a reallya really goodbunch of patterns that will take all of your common configs that most of us JavaScript developersare are writing and stick them under your package JSON.And that, to me, is super handy because, yeah, at least you can just\n\n17:46 Scott Tolinski:\nfold those up in an arrow, and then you don't see as much in in your sidebar. Yeah. Yeah. And this pattern is awesome. Because when I first saw this, I was like, okay. I already have a bunch of these myself, but then,of course,these are just so much beyond that, where it's like scooping up the ones that are connected to what it's specifically connected to. It cleans this all up. I I've been using this technique for a little bit and I'm a big fan of it. I think it it hides things nicely, but at the same time, you know, it's not hiding themto a point where you can't find them and typically you're looking for them with a command p anyways. So Yeah. Yeah. I I really like especially in your editor experience, just kinda shovel in the mall and eat the rug. It's it's really handy if you use a naming convention for components\n\n18:34 Wes Bos:\nLike, let let's say you have a search component, and then you have search dot you have your tests that are associated with that, and then you also have, like, a styles component. And then maybe you have another 1 for,like, the actual markup of it. Or and then maybe you also have, like, some some hooks that go with it or or maybe you have a data fetcher that goes along with that specific route. And before you know it, you have345different files that are all kinda named the same thing.You can stick those in a folder,but it's nice to just collapse them all underneath the, like, the main component.And then like, because what I do is I just open the main component. And if I wanna find the styles or the logic to fetch data or the tests, I just click through you just hit the command click in in your VS code. I don't go into the sidebar to find that file. I just oh, it's importing these styles, command click and it opens up the folder or the file that's associated with it. Mhmm. So I think I need to to check that out maybe a little bit more in in some of my folders. So that is config file 01:01 saving you. There's definitely manageable.I think thateither Npmand or GitHub need to step up nextandfind a way to make these types of files not so overwhelming when you're looking at a repo. There's there's a couple things that I think GitHub should do that. Andall of the, like, depend a bot stuff,it really muddies up all the pull requests, it muddies up all the git history,All that kind of stuff. Sometimes when I'm searching for something in, like, a Git repo,half the searches are just dependable. Pull request, and I'm just like, I just need to be able to they're important.Same with configs. They're important, but I need to filter them out.\n\n20:15 Scott Tolinski:\nWhen I'm trying to look for something. And it's important to know. I mean, it's an important note to say, like,the the more things get muddied, the more things there are,harder it is to find, but also the easier it is to miss things, the easier it is. If there's too much noise,you miss the actualthing you're looking for. So Yeah. Exactly. Fig fig, it's a necessary evil at this point,but I don't I don't see that changing anytime soon And I don't think the correct answer, like you mentioned, of of the top of the show, the correct answer isn't LOL modern front end development or modern development or whatever. That's not the answer. That doesn't help anything. It's not gonna go away. As long as we have tooling, we're going to need config.Tooling for releasing products tooling for helping us develop things,that's just how it is. So embracethe config,maybe embrace this cosmic config. I I think that's actually really pretty neat. What I would like to do, you know, West, that this episode's got me inspired to look at my config files and and at least standardize on a format, if that's possible.Because just looking at my repo, I don't have a ton of configs. I have a Cypress. I have a post CSS, I have a Svelte, Avit,an ES lint and a style lint.I ESLint Pnpm and a git ignore.But half of them are different formats.So\n\n21:37 Wes Bos:\nmaybe just standardize and land on 1 specific type file format even inside of your repo would make things a little less rough. If it's possible, that's good. I I'm curious now how many I have. So I have let me rattle through mine. Vercel, Lynn ignore.Get ignore, NPMRC,Caddy File, which is config for the local server, ENV sample,So that's a sample of the environmental variables that should be set. Obviously, the the actual environmental variable should not go into your Git repo.Package JSON, Pnpmlock, PMPM workspace,read me. Oh, that that's 1 we didn't even talk about as well, is that there's so many read me files. What do you have? There'scontributing to MD, read me, code of conduct, authors, license, all of that stuff. It's just like, oh my gosh. Pull request template,some of those a lot of those can go intoa GitHub folder, I believe. Dot GitHub folder, and and then GitHub will respect that. So that's nice. And also a lot of those don't need to be there for a lot of projects. Right? Where if you're not publishing packages or Yeah. I had I had of a bunch of products, like, just tiny little repo's.And I had a bunch of people likePR contributing and and code of conduct and all that stuff. And I was like, that'snot necessary. Like, if it it becomes an issue yeah. ButI I feel like it's a lot to justadd all these files to it and then it just becomesI I don't know. Maybe I am a bit too anxious on all these files, but it really bothers me. Oh, it bothers me too. Yeah. No. Definitely. And and that's why I think this cosmic convict thing is so appealing. I had no idea that so many things supported this already. Yeah. I the 1 thing I cannot find is like, where is there a list oftools that support Cosmit config? So what I ended up doing is I went toThis is actually a little feature I didn't know a whole lot about.If you go to a Git repo and you go to the insights tab and you click on the dependency graph,it will give you a list of packages that dependon this package.And this is way better than NPM'swhat does NPM have? They have a dependence tab. It's just a yeah. It's a dump of a million. And there's no way to, like, sort by most popular or whatever.So I just looked at that and I scrolled through it really quickly, and and I was like, oh, TypeScript's in here. Oh,all these different babbles in here. I've literally never looked at the insights tab. And get ever. It's it's awesome. If you go to insights dependencygraph, and then it will tell you it'll show you which projects. And this makes me hopeful that, like, Npm itself willjust be folded into GitHub at some point. Mhmm. Alright. I think that's it for today. Thanks everybody for tuning in.
