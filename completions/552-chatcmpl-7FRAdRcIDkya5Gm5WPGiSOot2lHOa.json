        "content": "\n00:01 Announcer:\nWelcome to Syntax, the delicious web development podcast. Fasten up and enjoy with Scott Tolinski and Wes Bos.\n\n00:11 Wes Bos:\nWelcome to Syntax, the podcast with the tastiest web development treats. Today's potluck is all about your questions on TypeScript, CSS, tooling, caching, routing, and more. To submit questions, visit Syntax and click \"Ask a Potluck Question\" in the top right corner. As always, I'm joined by Scott Tolinski. How are you, Scott? Hey, Yo! I'm doing good.\n\n00:47 Scott Tolinski:\nNot much to report; relieved that our Black Friday ordeal is done - always stressful. I launched a site redesign and survived, despite rarely doing it. Happy to be on the other side, now focusing on other life things. How about you? Feeling good.\n\n01:30 Wes Bos:\nRecording my TypeScript course, not much else. Today's sponsors are Lenode, Century, and Freshbook. Let's address our first question from Nick about the lack of contact info on our site.\n\nWe don't have a dedicated contact section due to unrelated requests, but do welcome feedback. There's a long list of changes we want to make to the site and app, including search and episode numbering. We are eager to improve and hear your suggestions. To Android users, we know you exist and value your input too.\n\nWe should start putting episode numbers in the podcast app for easy reference. Your feedback is essential, and we plan to make improvements accordingly.\n\n03:26 Scott Tolinski:\nSo, we should quickly search on the website. As we're contemplating various improvements, including a Svelte redesign, a contact us form might not be necessary. Since we receive enough contact through other means, adding a form could lead to an unanswered inbox, unless someone filters the messages for us. I've mentioned multiple times, I'm all in on Svelte because it is the best and fun.\n\n04:18 Wes Bos:\nWe're very busy. It happens. Visit west Bos dot com forward slash contact for a great contact page, listing common things. At the end, two contact methods are provided. One goes through my assistant, and I'll show you how to.\n\n04:41 Scott Tolinski:\nContact me to discuss the approach. Mike Adams, a backend dot net developer, appreciates the show and wants to know about the decision-making process for Level Up Tutorials. In 11 years, there have been three essential rewrites: moving from Drupal to Meteor, then from Meteor to React + GraphQL, and finally to Svelte. Other changes include transitioning from JavaScript to TypeScript and four major CSS redesigns. Despite seeming constant, these changes were made for important reasons.\n\nThe latest redesign involved a third-party designer, Travis Nielsen, who focused on user behavior rather than aesthetics. All updates were made with intention, and there won't be another major redesign in the near future. The rewrites were partly due to personal preferences and ADHD, but not necessarily recommended for others. Each decision was driven by a need to improve the platform.\n\n11:45 Wes Bos:\nWe're adding features, refactoring, and slowly transitioning to TypeScript. We have the tooling and base types generated from the database. As we work on code, it's refactored into TypeScript, making it a gradual process. Eventually, we'll turn off ESLint's allow JS flag and fully commit to TypeScript, taking a few days to tighten everything up. With my personal site, I've embraced the \"blow it up and start fresh\" approach over the years.\n\n12:35 Scott Tolinski:\nYes, I'd recommend the gradual approach for switching to TypeScript, especially if you don't want a whole month of challenges. When working on a file or component, just ensure it's in TypeScript with zero errors before moving on. This slower method has its complexities, like occasionally dealing with more extensive type-related issues, but it's not always the case. That's how we made the transition.\n\n13:09 Wes Bos:\nSo, callbacks. I had sync JS callbacks, and the whole platform used them since async await wasn't a thing when written. Then, we shifted to promises, refactoring as needed. We decided to drop the entire dependency, and I refactored 6 or 7 more untouched ones. Sometimes, code just works forever without intervention. I suggest a show on moving larger codebases to TypeScript, as it's a different beast, totally.\n\n13:56 Scott Tolinski:\nNext question from Mike, who appreciates the front-end insights. In the Deno episode, you mentioned Wes's site score without much explanation. Can you elaborate on what the score is, if 100 is the best, the goal or minimum, and how often you monitor it? \n\nMike's son understands scores out of 100. Like iPad battery percentages, for example.\n\nSo, what was the score and its significance?\n\n14:54 Wes Bos:\nSo yeah, sometimes we assume people know everything. Page Speed Insights is a tool where you input a URL, and it analyzes your website, checking factors like load time, CSS files, and image compression. Then it generates scores for performance, accessibility, best practices, and SEO. Ryan mentioned my score was 52, but when I checked, it was 87.\n\nSome people are obsessed with achieving a perfect score but may sacrifice content quality. The tool provides reasons for the scores and suggestions to improve them. It's the developer's job to decide what changes to make or what to keep, as not everything can be removed to achieve a 100 score. This tool is useful for identifying areas for improvement on a website.\n\n16:27 Scott Tolinski:\nWhat truly matters is the site's user experience at slower speeds or 3G networks, not just a high score. It's essential to know what using the site feels like for users with lower performance. The new site's mobile scores aren't great, but desktop scores are fine, with a 20 on mobile.\n\n17:13 Wes Bos:\nNo. Oh, yeah. Mobile. Desktop 82. Oh, what a difference. Holy. Yeah. Desktop I know.\n\n17:19 Scott Tolinski:\nFor both desktop and mobile, I get good SEO and accessibility scores but lower performance. I score 76 on desktop and 23 on mobile. The hero video and improperly sized images, with 2 being larger than needed, affect the scores. It's an easy fix. For those wondering how a new redesign isn't perfect, the rule is to get it working first, then optimize. I'll focus on performance next month. It's good enough for now.\n\n18:19 Wes Bos:\nsyntax RSSfeedAnd on the home page -- Yes. -- 7.5\n\n18:25 Scott Tolinski:\nmegs. The feed is? Yeah.\n\n18:28 Wes Bos:\nWe have an API that you should use. I haven't run this site through page speed insights, as sometimes you just need to launch it. We didn't have an extra 2 days for optimizations; we needed it for Black Friday. I'll remove the RSS feed and make a video about improving the site speed. In fact, I made a similar YouTube video years ago about my awful page speed. Let's go through all of this.\n\n19:19 Scott Tolinski:\nSee how high it can get with these easy fixes using Cloudinary – simply a URL attack. Oh, definitely.\n\n19:31 Wes Bos:\nNext, we have a concern about Twitter's future under new management, considering its current political state and decisions being made. Both of us love Twitter and gained much value in our careers. We don't believe it's going anywhere, even with Elon Musk at the helm. If anything, the carcass would be valuable enough for someone else to pick up. We acknowledge issues like TweetDeck and spam but don't see its demise.\n\nMany suggest Mastodon as an alternative, and the developer in us loves the idea of a distributed, self-hosted platform. However, we're unsure if it will entirely replace Twitter.\n\n21:48 Scott Tolinski:\nThe person in me understanding social media doesn't believe it'll be successful like Twitter. What do you think? When using Mastodon, it doesn't seem good enough to replace Twitter. My guess is that the next big thing will be a web-based platform, not just mobile like iOS or Android apps. It needs to be versatile like Twitter.\n\nYou know, I never saw MySpace disappearing before it happened, so I can't say Twitter won't go anywhere. It's worse now with new ownership and paid features. Paying for the checkmark was a bad idea, as demonstrated quickly. I wouldn't pay for it; instead, I'd rather not have a checkmark at all, even paying to avoid it. So what features would you pay for on Twitter?\n\n23:18 Wes Bos:\nGot TwitterBlue on day one. I'm a power user and willing to pay. Editing tweets is helpful, but nothing else is. I'd pay for a better TweetDeck and tools to categorize.\n\n23:43 Scott Tolinski:\nManage my messages and bookmark tweets in an organized way that's easily found, like TweetDeck. I would pay for it, as would many social media brands. But the $8 a month for nothing and a blue check mark is a no.\n\nAlthough some believe Elon Musk makes dumb choices, he's not dumb. He's got more going on behind the scenes playing strategic chess. He'll use his influence as a political tool.\n\nI don't have any attachment to Twitter beyond finding new information and meeting great people. If the community square changes, I won't care.\n\n25:29 Wes Bos:\nIn that tone, smart people sharing cool things will happen somewhere, and it doesn't matter where. We'll go there or elsewhere. Many kids on TikTok aren't on Twitter; I see it with 50 TikTok videos. The next Twitter will be another platform surfacing interesting content for interesting people, ideally without building an audience. People spent 10 years gaining Twitter followers for significance, but like Google, good info should just rise to the top.\n\n26:30 Scott Tolinski:\nAlright. So if you were creating the next Twitter and needed a virtual private server, where would you go? I'd choose Linode. I'd host it at Linode.com, which is where I'd put mine.\n\n26:44 Wes Bos:\nIf you want to try Mastodon, use the $100 free credit from Linode to host your own instance. It's perfect for hosting your Node JS, PHP app, etc. Check out linode.com/syntax for $100 in free credit when signing up. Thank you, Linode, for sponsoring.\n\n27:19 Scott Tolinski:\nGot it. Jared asks about our business models: subscription versus one-time payments for courses and their pros and cons. My business model evolved from offering YouTube videos with a subscription for ad-free content and a better interface. However, this didn't work well, so I switched to offering exclusive courses for subscribers, which increased subscription numbers. Pros include more predictability and recurring revenue. Cons include needing to consistently produce high-quality content.\n\nOn the other hand, the opposite model is releasing single courses with one-time payments.\n\n30:01 Wes Bos:\non their domain. When I began, rails casts was popular, along with Lara Cas, peep code, and numerous others trying to start similar $5/month unlimited courses.\n\n30:24 Scott Tolinski:\nwhatever. You know? Mhmm. I actually Bos mine off of\n\n30:27 Wes Bos:\nI initially based my course on Rails Cast, with the idea of offering single-purchase courses instead of a monthly subscription. I wanted to create comprehensive courses, like my beginner JavaScript course that took over a year to develop. My aim was to provide a complete resource for learning specific topics, like TypeScript, without stringing together various resources.\n\nDespite suggestions to switch to a subscription model or consolidate course domain names, I opted to continue with single products. Ten years later, even Egghead has started adopting a similar approach. Some believe they can simply replicate my method, but there's more to successful courses than just recording content. My focus remains on creating valuable, standalone courses for learners.\n\n31:55 Scott Tolinski:\nI've been enjoying the process of creating premium content behind a paywall. I once attempted to transition into single course releases, but failed due to choosing a difficult topic - React Native. I created a comprehensive course, but it didn't sell well and became outdated quickly. React Native changes rapidly and has many quirks, leading to a lot of customer support issues. Users experienced errors and platform changes that made learning difficult. This experience negatively impacted me for a year and left me feeling upset.\n\n33:13 Wes Bos:\nGreat question from WestcottTolinski! I painted my office Westcott Navy - unforgettable. Whenever asked, I say it's Westcott Navy.\n\n33:31 Scott Tolinski:\nYeah. Oh, man. That's so cool. I could not tell you what mine is, and it's not West Scott Navy.\n\n33:38 Wes Bos:\nWondering about hex codes? WestBos.com has all Benjamin Moore colors. Did you name it BM intentionally? It’s amusing.\n\nConsidering freelancing or starting a small web dev company instead of working for \"the man\"? Good for you. However, some concerns include managing a career dev job and enjoying the work based on preferred stacks. You prefer JavaScript and TypeScript full-stack but wonder if you can pick and choose projects when starting out.\n\nAnother concern is clients hiring more expensive American talent versus cheaper, talented devs elsewhere. Losing gigs to lower prices is a legitimate worry.\n\nFreelancing works for some and not for others - you need to run a business while coding. Diverse stacks can improve appreciation for different approaches. Senior devs adapt to various tools and the constraints of particular stacks. Choosing projects might be possible.\n\nThe America vs. elsewhere issue can be addressed by personal branding, networking, and solid communication. Developing strong relationships with clients is important. You need to understand their business problems, demonstrate your coding solutions, and improve your offering compared to cheaper options. It's not only about coding; understanding and meeting clients' needs is vital.\n\nIf coding without interruptions appeals to you, freelancing might not be a good fit. But if you believe you can help businesses by solving problems with code, go for it.\n\n37:22 Scott Tolinski:\nI did freelance work, but didn't like being my own manager, handling communication and design aspects. I preferred having a project with a deadline. Different personalities suit different work styles. Choosing the right tech for clients was tough, as I'd get fixated on a design or style that may not be ideal for them, which applies to tech as well. It's crucial to make smart choices in tech and bug solving.\n\nOne sponsor, Century, offers a tool that identifies and reports bugs in your stack, helping you understand which errors need immediate attention or are just one-off situations. Century.io also shows regressions affecting users. I use it constantly to keep an eye on any issues. Check out Century.io, and use the coupon code \"tastytreateslint\" for 2 free months. Thanks to Century for sponsoring.\n\n40:25 Wes Bos:\nNext question from Hugh Montso: After 20 years, I still don't feel senior. Can anyone relate? I'm good at my job but don't feel senior. This is part coding question, part therapy session. It's funny, I've coded for 16-17 years and can do most tasks. Feeling senior, to me, is being okay with not understanding something, knowing I can figure it out. Learning new libraries, knowing enough JavaScript and coding to tackle challenges. That's where senior people might be. What do you think, Scott? Defining senior dev varies per organization.\n\n41:39 Scott Tolinski:\nWhat does a senior dev do? I became one when my boss left, and I had to do his tasks. This may differ from other senior dev roles. It's about your perception of a senior dev and updating your mindset. If you've been developing for 20 years and still don't feel senior, you might be focusing on code problems. Senior devs often have managerial responsibilities too. Identify the characteristics you're lacking, gain them, and declare yourself a senior dev.\n\nAs for managing notifications, turn them all off except for essential ones like calendar. Use focus states to schedule notifications and avoid distractions from social media apps. Turn on iMessage only when necessary, otherwise keep it off during work hours. Be in control of when you check emails and utilize focus states to stay organized.\n\n45:37 Wes Bos:\nI utilize a policy where notifications are convenient but not crucial. If I miss any from tweets to my downloads folder, it's okay. The downloads folder should contain no important items and if it does, they should be moved for processing. I don't enable notifications for social media apps, and have limited iMessage notifications to only a few people. My do not disturb activates automatically when I'm recording, preventing distractions. Essentially, don't worry too much and battle for your time and focus. This allows you to create quality work. Keep essential communication like Slack for team settings.\n\n47:09 Scott Tolinski:\nSchedule work time and use do not disturb mode, allowing coworkers to ping or @ you if needed, while turning off other notifications. Utilize apps like Hazel, a Mac app that sets up rules to automatically manage and clean up your file system such as moving photos to specific folders or deleting items every few minutes.\n\n48:27 Wes Bos:\nI wonder if the shortcuts app can handle HEIC iPhone photos. It frustrates me that airdropping a HEIC photo to the desktop isn't usable directly. I understand why, but I won't change it to JPEG since I like all other features except the incompatibility issue.\n\n49:01 Scott Tolinski:\ncan't use it anywhere. Worst part was an Apple support call. They asked for a picture, but their chat doesn't support their own image format. I had to convert it before sending. If we use that format, the world should update to it. It was ported.\n\n49:27 Wes Bos:\nI right-clicked and converted it to JPEG with the Mac automation thing, an action. It works well, but I dislike clicking. It'd be cool if HEIC files in my downloads folder converted to JPEG automatically. That would be a minor improvement in my life.\n\n49:57 Scott Tolinski:\nIt's all about minor improvements, right? Recently, I used West's idea of small Tupperware tubs for tables, and it made my storage area and cable organization really nice.\n\n50:16 Wes Bos:\nI've had Caitlyn ask for a splitter or cable to charge something 3 or 4 times. It's great that I can just open the door and have everything. I wish my life was always that organized. I need a label maker since I didn't have masking tape. I put everything in tubs but then realized I needed to open all of them to find stuff since I got frosted tubs.\n\nLet's talk about label makers. I have 2 regular ones where you put the tape in and it prints. But now there are small thermal label printers. They use glossy paper instead of regular paper. You can type on your phone, which I prefer over using the label maker's keyboard.\n\n51:27 Scott Tolinski:\nI've been considering getting one of those. There are about 800 on Amazon currently. It seems there's a standard.\n\n51:39 Wes Bos:\n1, you can purchase fun stickers. We even buy labels saying \"boss kids\" for our kids' water bottles and such. This doesn't assist with that. I'm pondering 50-50.\n\n51:55 Scott Tolinski:\naround $20. At 20 23, 26, 20 set. What's the name? Currently viewing Jadens, JADENS.\n\n52:05 Wes Bos:\nlabel maker. There's a big one with loads of labels, and I want that one: PrinterNimbot, NIIMB0T. It's a handheld thermal printer without the\n\n52:23 Scott Tolinski:\nThis reminds me of when I worked at Target at 16. They left the label maker unattended, so I'd name walkie talkies, usually with names of people who didn't work there. I managed to name half of them before they asked the perpetrator to stop - but I continued, and they couldn't catch me! I'd also submit bad poems to the employee newsletter under a pseudonym, and they'd always publish them. I found it hilarious, wondering what the 20 or so employees reading it thought.\n\n54:14 Wes Bos:\nSec. Let's discuss Freshbooks, one of our sponsors with a new exclusive offer: 90% off for 4 months. Try it free without a credit card at freshbooks.com/syntax. They offer easy-to-use cloud invoicing, expensing, time tracking, project management, payments, reporting, accounting, and more. I've run my business with it since the beginning. Check it out at freshbooks.com/syntax. Thanks for sponsoring.\n\n54:54 Scott Tolinski:\nThis anonymous user asks what testing tools are popular for node apps today. 99% of the time, you'll see JEST (jest.io) as the go-to library. However, VITEST (vitest.dev) is gaining traction due to its ESLint usage, speed, and NodeVET integration. It's easy to switch from JEST to VITEST without significant changes, resulting in faster tests. Some users encounter issues when moving to VITEST due to the presence of common JS.\n\n55:51 Wes Bos:\nVercel. It won't work if there's even one common JS dependency. Expect pain. Mocha chai tape are popular in the node world for running tests. They all serve as test runners. Right?\n\n56:15 Scott Tolinski:\nYeah, you're essentially swapping performance, right? Like, v test, you're like, \"What's the\n\n56:23 Wes Bos:\nWhy use the test? It's faster and uses the entire GEST API. Simply transfer your GEST tests to Vercel test. KleMAS from London asks about the Tan Stack router versus rack router v6 for an e-commerce store. It's inspired by TRPC, Remix, and Shikani. What's Shikani? An artificial narrowing turn or road on an auto, known as Shaquane.\n\n57:08 Scott Tolinski:\nShaquane? Is that what you said? Shaquane.\n\n57:10 Wes Bos:\nLikely not what I said. Shaquane. Google told me to check out Shaquane, a simple, safe router for React and TypeScript. I personally use React location in my platform, and it's great. Seems like TanStack router is the next step and language agnostic.\n\nThere are adapters for different frameworks, but TanSack router is still in early stages with half the docs pending. It has a first-class search parameters API and 100% inferred TypeScript Npm, meaning you don't need to type anything and still get type safety due to inference.\n\nIt also has features like route transition, file splitting, caching, and data fetching. Would I use it? It's pretty early, so I might not bet on it yet, but given Tanner Tolinski's track record, it's likely to be very good. I'm here for more options.\n\n59:36 Scott Tolinski:\nIs excellent and will be. I have no room for it in my life. When writing a React site, I'd choose a remix 10/10 times. For an unknown site, I'd pick Astro, but I prefer Astro Remix or Svelte Kit. It's great, has a router, and suits many people, but not me. React query was rewritten as Tanstag query.\n\n01:00:18 Wes Bos:\nTypeScript safe. Same concept works everywhere and I think it's great. If building a complex Svelte site, I might use this since I've had positive experiences with it. If using SvelteKit, stick with their data - it's good.\n\n01:00:40 Scott Tolinski:\nIt's good.\n\n01:00:41 Wes Bos:\nOkay, so we need to invite him back. He has numerous projects, including React charts, virtual UI for large scrolling lists, and tables under his company, Nozzle.io. It's a data-heavy company, and he created this incredible table that is now open source.\n\n01:01:08 Scott Tolinski:\nCool stuff! Let's jump into sick pics and a shameless plug. My sick pick is a label maker that I got on Black Friday. I didn't shop much, but I got a smart controller for my heat pump and AC unit in my office. Before, controllers were pricey, required installation, and lacked features. So, I got the Sensible Air, an IR blaster for thermostats that works with numerous models.\n\nIt's easy to set up and control with my phone, and it integrates with my smart home automation system, like Home Assistant or Apple. Prices start at $70 for the basic model. This device helps me manage my office temperature efficiently, potentially saving on heating costs by adjusting the temperature based on my presence.\n\n01:02:54 Wes Bos:\nThat's cool. I love making things smart without purchasing new versions, just using IR. It's affordable compared to other options. I'm going to watch the WeCrashed TV series you mentioned. It's an 8-episode, hour-long, non-documentary show about WeWork. I wasn't fully informed about their story, but it's fascinating. I rarely watch TV, usually 20-30 mins a night. However, I watched 2-3 hours of this series nightly and eagerly awaited bedtime for kids. It's rare for me to find a TV series I genuinely like, so this WeCrashed series is fantastic.\n\n01:04:16 Scott Tolinski:\nWe discussed manifesting before in an episode. We often say, \"I'm manifesting a really good week,\" and it's important.\n\n01:04:26 Wes Bos:\nThe characters and acting are fantastic. I loved watching and simultaneously reading their Wikipedia pages. These real people and their startup funding stories are likely exaggerated, but still outrageous.\n\n01:04:49 Scott Tolinski:\nIt's a wild world. That guy received even more money from someone else. People simply can't stop giving him money.\n\n01:05:00 Wes Bos:\nBut he, like, made it out with heaps of money, you know? No spoilers, it's known. And then someone's like, \"hey, let's give him\n\n01:05:13 Scott Tolinski:\nmore money?\n\n01:05:15 Wes Bos:\nHow about that guy?\n\n01:05:16 Scott Tolinski:\nJust crazy. It's just yeah. It's just all personality.\n\n01:05:20 Wes Bos:\nOMG, yeah, great suggestion! Check out \"We Crashed\" for holiday viewing, for sure.\n\n01:05:27 Scott Tolinski:\nCheck out LevelUp.video, a Vercel tutorials website offering various video content tutorials, including a new SvelteKit course. The course will be divided into several parts covering different aspects, such as working with a database or Superbase. The first part, focused on fundamentals, is available.\n\n01:05:56 Wes Bos:\nI built the site on Svelte kit, so I know what I'm talking about.
