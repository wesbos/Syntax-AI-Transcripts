        "content": "\n00:01 Announcer:\nMonday. Monday. Deno. Open wide dev fans. Prepare to stuff your face with JavaScript, CSS, node modules, BBQ tips, git workflows, breakdancing, soft skills, web development, the hastiest, craziest, and tape-wrapped dev treats. Coming in hot. Here's West. Barracuda, Bos, and Scott El Doro Loco. Totally Ski.\n\n00:29 Scott Tolinski:\nOh, welcome to syntax. In today's Monday hasty treat, we'll discuss config files, our love for them, and their abundance. I'm Scott Tolinski, a Denver developer, joined by West Bos. West, how are your config files? Is your project root full of them? My project root looks good, but I stumbled upon one the other day with 30 config files - I think that's a record for me.\n\n01:07 Wes Bos:\nAnd the response was really interesting. Many people were like, modern web development, LOL, garbage, even though half of them weren't related to front-end development. And, we kind of need them, you know. I don't like it either; it's so obnoxious with a Git repo root full of different files. So, we're here to help you escape config file hell and figure out how to make this manageable in local dev and some ideas about how node has failed this year. We'll get into that too. Yeah. How are you? You just got back from skiing, right? Yeah, I was telling you I got the classic.\n\n01:57 Scott Tolinski:\nMy nose is bright red and my jaw is sunburned because I didn't wear sunscreen for some reason. I usually do. I took Landon skiing, and we drove out early and sat in traffic for 3 hours on the way home. With a 5-year-old in the car, I hoped he'd take a nap and not need a bathroom break, but luckily we were all good.\n\nDriving my electric car to the mountains with Landon for the first time, I wasn't sure what to expect. We went to one of the closer mountains, about an hour and 15 minutes away without traffic. On the way, my battery went down to around 45-50%, but I knew we were mostly going uphill, gaining 8000 feet in elevation.\n\nSurprisingly, on the way home, my battery gained 3% within an hour due to downhill driving. My car's mileage till empty increased, which was great! Ultimately, I got home with around 80 miles still left on the battery.\n\n03:53 Wes Bos:\nbarely used any battery due to reach. It was incredible. Wow. So, you can almost use your whole battery going up the mountain. They hope. Right. Gotta go there. We have a massive hill here in Hamilton, split into downtown and up the mountain. When we go down, I always wonder about battery usage. I'd tell my wife not to speed down and not hit brakes, as it's free. But then I got a ticket. So.\n\n04:29 Scott Tolinski:\nFlying down, yeah. On that same regard, there are spots driving into the Rocky Mountains West with a couple minutes of steep downward slopes. They have pull-offs for trucks with brake issues. It's intense if you're inexperienced, as you can go from 50 to 100 mph without realizing, needing to ride the breaker. That's why driving manual is better, as you can keep it in a lower gear with engine assistance. But okay, config file. Sorry.\n\n05:03 Wes Bos:\nAlright, so we need config files. They're used for configuring dev tooling like ESLint, prettier, VS code, build tooling, TypeScript, Babbel, SWBC, and your infrastructure. One thing I really like is that often, config files represent your infrastructure, which means you're describing your hosting, integrations, and domain names as code. Instead of logging in and remembering which buttons to press, you can simply create a config file. As much as people dislike them, I'd prefer having the entire AWS infrastructure configured in a single file rather than needing to.\n\n05:52 Scott Tolinski:\nRemember which and suppress and whatnot, because there's no way you'll set that up perfectly a second time. Mhmm. Other kinds include ignore files, NPM ignore, git ignore, repo details, contributing, etc. There are many. All these fill the root of your project; and although it's not the source, it tells a lot about the application. These configs help reproduce the same settings across environments, making life easier. My main critique with config files is the variety of formats. We have config dot JSON for Cypress, config dot JS for post CSS, and for Svelte and Veet, JSON config for TS, NPMRC as its own thing. What even are those files like an ENV file or Pnpm? Is that a specific format with key-value pairs? Is there a name for that?\n\n07:04 Wes Bos:\nThat's a good question since you consider the prettier RC, which is JSON. But what about others, like bash RC, which is bash? I think that a specific RC file isn't a particular type. It's often simple key-value pairs in bash syntax or key-value syntax. I'm unsure about the exact term and if it even has a name.\n\n07:36 Scott Tolinski:\nTo me, that's a major pinpoint when considering config files, right? Everyone selects their preferred format, making it frustrating switching between them.\n\n07:50 Wes Bos:\nI think my favorite is definitely JavaScript for config files because you can sometimes write JavaScript in them. Many places don't allow it since config files should be static and not computed. But it's nice to, for example, have a VIT config file that, when I run my VIT server for hot tips, automatically opens up the last edited HTML file. It's so convenient when I have 200 different index.html folders and instead of searching for the one I'm currently working on, it simply opens the last modified one. I just wrote a bit of code that looked at the file system and sorted by\n\n09:31 Wes Bos:\nLevel is super handy. I posted the link in the show notes for the viet 1 as well. It's probably not all that helpful for people running React apps or whatever. But if you have a folder where you're always fussing and that's your demo folder, it's really handy. Being able to write JavaScript in these things doesn't have to be complex to be useful. They're just nice little niceties. \n\nOther things we have are in Yamal, TOMal, and a bunch of different things out there. They can also go in your package dot JSON. I like putting them in package JSON because it's just one less file to do. But often I find myself being like, ugh, I hate writing JSON as well. You have to double quote it and can't do comments. \n\nThankfully, a lot of the config files that are in JSON are JSON 5, which means you can have trailing comma, put comments in there, and do all kinds of stuff like that, which is nice. So for very simple stuff, I'll throw it in my package JSON. Otherwise, I have to create a new file for it. I almost never put it in package dot JSON even though I think that's the most ideal scenario.\n\n10:47 Scott Tolinski:\nBecause I personally would love to scoop up all of my configs and put them into package.json, which is like your app's config in the first place. But as you said, there are no comments in DenoJavaScript. The no-comments thing is a big deal. The format just kind of stinks in general compared to what you get elsewhere with JSON 5 or JavaScript, or even Yamal. Yeah, totally.\n\n11:18 Wes Bos:\nI feel I should mention this here: I believe node and Npm have somewhat failed us. People discussed needing a standard for config files, enabling defining them in various formats - import syntax, common JS, TypeScript. We should extend configs, like in ESLint, and deep merge them if desired. It would be great if Npm established a standard, as most configs in my folder relate to their tooling. Python has something similar; it'd be nice to have a standard config type going forward.\n\n12:23 Scott Tolinski:\nYeah, actually, it's funny when we discussed this or when you first mentioned it on Twitter, I recalled a Twitter thread where Kent C. Dodd talked about this last year. I googled it and found the thread - it was quite interesting with many comments on pros, cons, and educated discussion around a config folder idea. So, it might be interesting to some people. Totally agree. There could be a situation like the xKCD comic about a standard and,\n\n13:11 Wes Bos:\nYou know, it's true that people have different preferences for configuration standards and handling edge cases, and that's probably why no one has really tackled it yet. Cosmic Config, however, is one package that tool authors can use to load in configs, allowing the use of package JSON, JSON, YamL RC files, or even putting configs in a Config directory. This last option cleans up the root of your repo a lot.\n\nSometimes, trying to find specific code in a repo with many folders can be overwhelming. A cool idea for a show could be to analyze 8000 repos, see the most common directories, and then explain their purposes. Cosmic Config folder and the dot config are well supported by tools like TypeScript, prettier, jest, ESLint, and babble. Webpack doesn't use it, but most tools allow specifying config file location as an argument.\n\nAlthough not perfect, putting everything in the config folder might work for 90-95% of cases. However, once it's working, it's hard to change.\n\n15:42 Scott Tolinski:\nMove those things around. So, to confirm in plain English, if one of these supports cosmic config, TypeScript, prettier, jest, ESLint, pebble, it means you can put them into a dot config folder without issues. And to be clear, that's a dot config folder, right? Yeah, dot config/tsconfig/dot prettierrc/eslintrc and all those good things. You can toss that tsconfig in a dot config folder now. I didn't know TypeScript allowed it. Yeah, and it'll find it. It's interesting because someone has to bite the bullet and start putting stuff in a config folder, and then, yeah.\n\n16:23 Wes Bos:\nYou know? I like it because many desktop tools allow for the root. For example, if you go to Tilda on your machine, you have 400 dot files. But you can usually put those in a dot config file folder to clean up your local machine's directory. \n\nYou're right. What else do we have? Something released in VS Code a week or 2 ago is called file nesting. Oh, it's been there for a bit? I must have missed it then. It lets you specify file types with another file in VS Code. One common use is to take all your configs and put them under your package JSON, nesting them. You have to do it yourself, as there're no good defaults, but there's a great set of patterns by Fu that help JavaScript developers stick common configs under the package JSON. It's super handy because, well, at least you can just\n\n17:46 Scott Tolinski:\nFold those up in an arrow, and then there's less in your sidebar. This pattern is fantastic. Initially, I thought I have many of these, but these go beyond, scooping up connected ones specifically. It cleans everything up. I've used this technique for a while and I'm a fan. It hides things effectively, but not to the point of being unfindable, typically using command p. I especially like it in the editor experience, just shoveling them all under the rug. It's really handy if you use a naming convention for components.\n\n18:34 Wes Bos:\nSo, let's say you have a search component, and then you have search tests, a styles component, and like, the actual markup or some hooks, or maybe a data fetcher for a specific route. Before you know it, there are lots of files, all kinda named similarly. You can put them in a folder, but it's nice to collapse them under the main component. I usually open the main component, and if I want to find the styles, logic, or tests, I just command click in VS Code - it's more convenient.\n\nConfig files are manageable, but I think either NPM or GitHub should make these files less overwhelming when looking at a repo. GitHub can improve, like with dependabot stuff, which muddies up pull requests and git history. Sometimes, when I search in a git repo, half the searches are just dependabot pull requests. They're important, same with configs, but I need to filter them out.\n\n20:15 Scott Tolinski:\nWhen searching for something important, it's crucial to note that the more cluttered things are, the harder it is to find and easier it is to miss them. This \"fig fig\" is a necessary evil, and it won't change soon. The answer isn't to complain about modern development; tooling and configuration will always be needed. So embrace the config, perhaps this cosmic config, as it is quite interesting.\n\nThis episode has inspired me to look at my config files and attempt to standardize their format, if possible. In my repo, I have a mix of configs with different formats, such as Cypress, post CSS, Svelte, Avit, ESLint, Stylelint, Pnpm, and git ignore files.\n\n21:37 Wes Bos:\nMaybe just standardize on one specific file format within your repo to make things less rough. So, let me list mine: Vercel, .gitignore, .npmrc, Caddyfile (config for local server), .env sample (sample of environment variables that should be set), package.json, pnpm-lock, pnpm-workspace, readme. And there are so many readme files, contributing.md, code of conduct, authors, license, and more. Pull request templates and others can go into a .github folder, which GitHub will respect. However, not all projects need these files. I've had small repos with people PR-ing unnecessary files, and it bothers me. This is why the cosmic config idea is appealing, with numerous tools supporting it. To find supported tools, go to Git repo's insights tab, click on the dependency graph for packages that depend on this package, which is better than NPM's dependency tab. This gives hope that NPM might fold into GitHub eventually. Thanks for tuning in, catch you on Wednesday!\n\n24:28 Scott Tolinski:\nVisit syntax.fm for a complete archive of our shows.
