Fasten your seat belt and enjoy!\n\n00:11 Wes Bos:\nWelcome to Syntax, the podcast with top web development treats. In today's fundamentals episode, we're covering web workers and service workersâ€”what they are, why you need them, and how they work. We have three fantastic sponsors: Log Rocket, TypeScript session, and Freshbooks. As always, I'm joined by Scott Tolinski. How are you, Scott?\n\n00:57 Announcer:\nWe briefly discussed this on Friday, but Landon got into his top choice public school. In Denver, you have your default neighborhood school, but you can also enter a lottery to attend other public schools in the city. There's an excellent school down the block from us which wasn't our default option, and we were on a waiting list with 200 other kids. It's been a stressful summer waiting to hear if he got in, as he did get accepted into another good school that is further away (about 15-20 minutes). We faced the decision of sending him to the nearby but less desirable school or the great but distant one. On Friday, we received news that Landon was accepted into the top-ranked school that's also close by. He was among only 5 kids pulled off the waiting list, so it seemed nearly impossible, but it happened! We are thrilled about the outcome.\n\n02:25 Wes Bos:\nHearing those things is always nerve-wracking, especially when you have no idea and need to plan your life around it. We have the same issue with daycare, trying to get our kid into one. It's just like,\n\n02:38 Announcer:\nSo, you'll tell us? Thanks. Why is it so difficult to find a good place for my child during the day? The public school situation is tough because they're unequal. You must be vigilant about where your kid goes to school. We even considered private schools until we saw the cost, which is like college tuition. Ultimately, it wasn't the right option for us. It was quite stressful, but now it feels like a weight is lifted. In Denver, can you choose any public school? Here, you need to live in the district, and that's why people buy houses.\n\n03:37 Wes Bos:\nnot for the house, but they'll buy a house just so they can get into the district.\n\n03:41 Announcer:\nSo, we put ESLint as our top choice for preferred schools and ended up on the waitlist. With about 200 kids trying to get in, we got lucky with our randomized spot. They prioritize neighborhood kids, and if there are open spots, they use the lottery system. Courtney was even sending me house listings in that neighborhood, asking if we could consider moving. But no, that's not happening.\n\n04:33 Wes Bos:\nAlright, let's dive into web workers and service workers by first discussing threads in programming and JavaScript. Threads in programming allow multiple compute-intensive tasks, like resizing an image or generating a PDF, to run simultaneously. Many programming languages are multi-threaded, enabling multiple tasks to run in parallel. JavaScript, however, is not multi-threaded, meaning it can only perform one task at a time.\n\nPeople often say JavaScript isn't multi-threaded but can perform two tasks concurrently. There's a difference between concurrency and parallelism. A system is concurrent if it supports two or more actions in progress simultaneously, while parallelism means two or more actions execute simultaneously. JavaScript uses concurrency, queueing tasks and managing them to give the illusion of parallelism.\n\nAs developers, it's not crucial to understand the difference between concurrency and parallelism, but it's a common interview question.\n\n06:59 Announcer:\nSo, we just like, run our code, right? We type it, make a promise, and wait for it to resolve. You almost forget about it because placing things in specific threads isn't a concern. It just works. But there's this concept of thread blocking in single-thread scenarios that you should be aware of. West, do you ever worry about blocking the main thread in JavaScript when programming?\n\n07:36 Wes Bos:\nI haven't, but it's difficult to write synchronous code in JavaScript that can lock the entire browser while doing other tasks. In my 12 years of coding, I haven't encountered that situation. However, performance-minded people or those doing resource-intensive tasks in browsers, or working with frameworks like React, may be more concerned about it. If that's the case, it could slow down actions like clicking or moving within a snappy application, making you notice the difference in speed. Though I haven't run into this issue personally, I understand there's a misconception about it.\n\n08:40 Announcer:\nLike, async await may seem like it blocks the main thread, but I don't worry about it, personally. I usually just focus on writing my UI and fixing any jank or latency afterwards. I rarely consider if I'm blocking the main thread. Using web pre markers helps me avoid such issues.\n\n09:18 Wes Bos:\nSo, parallel and multi-threaded applications aren't available in JavaScript. Imagine a resource-intensive task in the browser, like green screen processing on webcam images. You'd need to loop over millions of pixels fast, ideally 40-60 times a second. But in the main thread, it's difficult to achieve that due to limitations.\n\nFor example, if you're processing a video and have an ad animation simultaneously, it could slow down the animation. To solve this, you'd want to run intensive calculations on a separate thread so they don't impact main browser functions, such as user interactions or animations.\n\nThis can be done in JavaScript using web workers, allowing you to offload work from the main browser thread onto another thread, called a worker. The work is carried out on a separate thread, and messages about progress can be sent back as needed. It can be compared to having an express lane on a highway, where certain tasks are assigned and processed separately without affecting the main traffic flow.\n\n12:08 Announcer:\nBy shifting tasks to a worker, you allow them to enter the express ESLint lane, easing system pressure. This is crucial for resource-intensive work on the main thread that could slow down UI, JavaScript, and interaction. By relocating these tasks to the express lane, users perceive better performance as it takes advantage of existing CPU features.\n\n13:00 Wes Bos:\nWe've never truly utilized the potential of web workers, so let's explore some examples and understand how they work. There are two major uses for web workers: offline caching and notifications. However, we'll put those aside for now. Just know that these are features of service workers, a specific type of web worker. \n\nAnother important use is for analytics. Tracking user behavior, such as clicks, errors, or product views, is commonly done via analytics APIs. These APIs can slow down the main thread, so Builder IO's \"party town\" library can relocate resource-intensive scripts to a web worker to speed things up. This is especially useful for loading tools like Google Analytics or Intercom chat.\n\nAlex from Twitter suggests generating PDFs with potentially hundreds of pages using a React renderer in the background, which could also benefit from running in a web worker.\n\nNick Taylor shares an interesting use case: mocking API endpoints before they're fully built using Mock Service Worker JS (MSWJS). This allows developers to return mock data, like an array of pizzas, before the actual backend is ready. It doesn't even require building a server. In fact, ESLint uses MSW for this purpose.\n\n16:08 Announcer:\nTo run our Cypress tests faster, we use a service worker to return mock data, preventing API calls from hitting the server. This works as long as the API schema is in place. We use a package like Cypress, MSW, GraphQL, which are tenuously connected, meaning if one breaks, the whole setup breaks. The downside is that it doesn't work in a node environment. It's unclear if Deno, with its web workers, will solve this issue.\n\n16:55 Wes Bos:\nYes, Deno has a web work API, as its purpose is to install web standards like workers. Node is also implementing this and has its own API for multi-threading.\n\n17:13 Announcer:\nI'm sure they'll introduce the web worker API eventually, improving my life. Currently, I use a script for testing to ensure the site runs without server side rendering, but then I wonder if it's ideal to test a client side rendered site.\n\n17:31 Wes Bos:\nTo obtain mock data, Sam Hall on Twitter mentioned storing file handlers in index DB, but it can be slow writing thousands of rows. So, he uses a service worker to queue batches of writes. IndexedDB is like a powerful local storage database in the browser, able to save thousands of elements like in the TL Draw app. Sam Hall sends data to a service worker to save periodically to index DB. He confirmed it's possible to access the same index DB instance from both the web worker and the browser, though simultaneous access is tricky.\n\nJill Menning on Twitter uses web workers to handle large file downloads, providing the ability to abort. This is helpful for downloading large files in chunks, allowing users to pause and resume, avoiding restarts if the download is interrupted. These are some interesting use cases for web workers in managing data storage and large downloads.\n\n19:49 Announcer:\nLet's discuss web workers further, but first, let's mention one of our favorite sponsors, LogRocket. It's an ideal platform to understand your users' interactions with your application through scrubbable video replay, surfacing issues impacting conversion rates and tracking errors to stop guessing about bug causes. Being able to see user actions, access consoles and networks, and understand why things break provides great insights. With LogRocket, comprehending user behavior for conversion, engagement, and retention is easier. Visit logrocket.com/syntax for a 14-day free trial. Thanks to LogRocket for sponsoring.\n\nNow, let's continue discussing web workers.\n\n22:46 Announcer:\nSo, it's sort of like sending a request or, you know, web sockets? You've got a ping and data. Yeah, it's kinda like WebSockets.\n\n22:59 Wes Bos:\nESLint isn't always open, and PostMessage is a browser API for sending data between origins, like WebWorkers or iframes. A use case is communicating the size of an iframe, as there's no height auto feature. The iframe measures its size, sends pixel values to the parent frame via PostMessage, and they can communicate regardless of domain names. Like click ESLint, you can add event listeners and use the PostMessage API to enable communication through a simple, well-established API.\n\n24:59 Wes Bos:\nStraight Js and then process it. Exactly, straight Js for looping over data, saving it, and accessing your IndexedDB for database tasks. JSON decoding is another example. Imagine receiving a huge JSON file that might lock up your browser for milliseconds or even a second when parsing. You can utilize a worker to handle that task, and once it's done, it'll notify you, and you can post the data back.\n\n25:45 Announcer:\nto the main thread. I'm curious if wasm could step in and help with offloading tasks that require performance. Is this a situation to consider wasm for a larger solution?\n\n26:04 Wes Bos:\nlarger canon, indeed. Good question. The advantage of WASM is offloading work to other languages at a lower level, while a web worker is for running more JavaScript on another thread. Web worker API is simpler; WASM requires a compiler and likely another language. So, WASM is more like Vercel but on a grander scale.\n\n26:44 Announcer:\na significant buy-in for that approach. I see there's parallel execution by spawning a web worker loading wasm with rust. So, wasm in web worker is a thing. Makes sense because\n\n27:02 Wes Bos:\nIf you want to talk to web assembly on a separate thread, that's possible, but it's not common for everyday developers. Typically, plugins or libraries handle this since it's more in the weeds. Web workers can run even when the browser is closed, allowing for offline sync â€“ a useful feature for service workers. There are limitations, but they can run in the background.\n\nService workers, which are pre-made web workers provided by browsers, can cache files, intercept network requests, and run code when the user isn't on the page. They enable background sync, offline access, and push notifications. Their ability to intercept network requests is crucial and similar to how Cloudflare functions and edge workers operate â€“ sitting at the network layer.\n\nWhen the browser fetches a file, a service worker can intercept the request, check its cache, and serve it if the cached version is recent enough. This enables fast loading and offline access. If a website is visited while offline, the entire site can still be accessed through the service worker's cache since it sits between the browser and the WiFi connection.\n\n31:20 Announcer:\nSo, when you say people can do that, how do they practically achieve it? How do they cash and serve their site for offline use? Are there pre-made scripts they're using, or is everyone writing their own?\n\n31:38 Wes Bos:\nSo, how do you create something like that? It's quite simple. Google has a workbox for this, but you can also check the link in the show notes for a roughly 25-line code example. This code intercepts all requests, saves them to cache if not already there, and serves cached content if available. It's not too much work to integrate this into any website.\n\n32:16 Announcer:\nGreat! Absolutely, it's essential to include here. Plus, it's useful for handling notifications.\n\n32:24 Wes Bos:\nNotifications function by registering your web worker, allowing your server to ping it and instruct it to send a notification.\n\n32:38 Announcer:\nTo the device that permitted it, are you using \"web worker\" and \"service worker\" interchangeably? What did I say? You mentioned \"web worker\" once, and \"service worker\" another time. So, is this a feature of service workers or web workers? When I hear about these, I have a hard time separating the two concepts and understanding the difference between a service worker and a web worker. A web worker is the underlying technology.\n\n33:15 Wes Bos:\nYou can run things in a separate thread with service workers, which are web workers with elevated APIs and permissions. This allows you to cache files, intercept network requests, and send notifications to users. These specialized APIs provide lower-level access to tasks not typically available in JavaScript, like network requests and caching files.\n\nNow let's talk about one of our sponsors, Sanity. It's a unified content platform for any content that powers websites, apps, TVs, or even restaurant sandwich boards. Sanity Studio lets you create content types and manage data, while offering Rest API, GraphQL API, and GRock, a powerful query language even more in-depth than GraphQL.\n\nNext time you need a CMS or backend for a project, check out sanity.io/syntax for double the free usage tier, and redeem the syntax coupon via the CLI. Thanks to Sanity for sponsoring.\n\n35:52 Announcer:\nthere's not too many companies out there that that have that kind of feature.\n\n35:57 Wes Bos:\nDiscussing the life cycle of a service worker, upon first page load, you install it. The code for caching files or sending notifications doesn't belong in regular TypeScript.js but in a separate JS file. Then, you install the service worker API. So, let's clarify the process.\n\n36:31 Announcer:\nWhile installing a service worker, it essentially grabs the JavaScript and saves it into your browser or local cache on your device. This way, when you visit the website again, the JavaScript is already saved, providing instructions that run before anything else. Is that accurate?\n\n37:05 Wes Bos:\nYes, so to register a service worker, you run navigator.serviceWorker.register in your JavaScript and give it your actual service worker file. Inside the service worker, you use self.addEventListener to listen for the install event, fetch event, and activate event. Once a service worker is installed, it runs every time you visit a website, and if it has network interception, it can serve up a local version if the user is offline.\n\nHowever, if you register a service worker without instructions to kill itself or refresh the cache, the cache will always be served up, making it difficult to get new files. You need logic in your service worker to either self-destruct, clear the cache, or refresh the cache.\n\nThe service worker will try to download a new version every time you visit a website, so if there's a new version, it can re-register and potentially show a pop-up to refresh the page. The service worker will know if the file has changed since it was last fetched, possibly through the browser's ability to detect changes, such as timestamps, code changes, or file size/hash.\n\nTo debug service workers, there's a tab in both Chrome and Firefox dev tools that shows what is currently running and allows you to register, start, or stop them. It's essential to have a self-destruct function in your service workers to avoid caching issues when users can't see the new version of the website. Remember to be cautious with service workers, as it can be tricky to navigate caching and ensuring users access the updated versions of sites.\n\n43:06 Announcer:\nHow about local development? Can you test it locally? What's the process and how to dodge pitfalls? The service worker is domain name-linked.\n\n43:18 Wes Bos:\nFor the origin, if you're on localhost 3000 and install a service worker, you can run it as if on a regular server. You need to run it through a server because it's a service worker, but there's no issue doing this locally. A common issue is when learners see something different than what's shown in a tutorial. This often happens if they've done another tutorial that installed a service worker, like with Create React App. The service worker caches everything, intercepting requests before they can do anything, as it occurs before the network.\n\nIn such cases, I had to inform people that they did another tutorial that cached something and there's no logic in it for it to delete itself. So, it's essentially stuck until it can be deleted. Now, I just use random ports that no one else would have ever used to avoid this issue. Running a service worker on my own tutorial isn't worth it.\n\nRegarding experience with Workbox, the service worker API is quite difficult to use. Google introduced Workbox to create a better API for doing things in service workers. Though I haven't used Workbox myself, I know that it is the preferred choice for most people working with service workers.\n\n45:19 Announcer:\nI often grab workbox first. I read on the felt kit service workers page about registering your service worker with your own logic, configure periodic updates, and using workbox. I thought, \"Workboxâ€“ when is the thing?\" Interesting.\n\n45:38 Wes Bos:\nSo, the fundamentals of service workers are not exactly simple. To me, it still seems cloudy.\n\n45:52 Announcer:\nI suppose it's something you gotta get your hands dirty with.\n\n45:55 Wes Bos:\nI did a workshop on service workers 3-4 years ago. I'll include links to the workshop notes with examples of cache naming and activation. There's an event called Update Found when a new service worker is available, allowing you to alert Vercel. It's an interesting feature, not for everyone, but necessary for building progressive or offline web apps and performing background tasks. Thanks, West.\n\n46:41 Announcer:\nPerhaps we should discuss our last sponsor, Freshbooks, before diving into our sick picks. Do you think they're utilizing service workers at Freshbooks?\n\n46:55 Wes Bos:\nI'll check my Freshbooks account quickly. Logging in, I see nothing on the landing page, understandably. Typically, it's in the app. In Firefox's application tab, I find no service workers. Let's visit a few websites to see which have service workers.\n\n47:26 Announcer:\nWhat other websites, Scott? I know when that is. I can access my favorite to-do app, production height dot app. Let's see. Log in. Login connecting, inspecting height dot app, application, c o registration. Surprised to see no service worker. I just went to Twitter, and Twitter\n\n47:58 Wes Bos:\nthe service worker. Examining the service worker code reveals a list of assets to be cached. Despite its simplicity, they're explicitly caching.\n\n48:16 Announcer:\nview assets on their hard Can you do this in Chrome or Firefox? In Chrome, go to application service workers, click \"see all registrations.\" It takes you to a browser page displaying every site with a registered service worker. I see Home Assistant, Stripe, Figma forums, Macrumors forums, Gustoâ€”all using service workers. Even Low Dash has a service worker. Interesting that Chrome can do this.\n\n48:54 Wes Bos:\nBreak it into notifications, background sync, fetch, push message. Many are service workers. Cool, right? Firefox has a service worker under the application tab. I'll check Notion for any. Surprisingly, no service workers on Notion. Interesting.\n\n49:16 Announcer:\nYes, I'm surprised about the ones that do and don't occur. When looking at applications, I thought some would use 1. Interesting stuff here. Wes, want a minute to discuss Freshbooks before diving into service worker stuff?\n\n49:35 Wes Bos:\nFreshbooks, the accounting software for business owners and accountants, is my go-to for tracking invoices, expenses, payments, and sending late payment reminders. My accountant can easily access everything, eliminating the need for spreadsheets. Try it for 30 days free at freshbooks.com/syntax.\n\n50:06 Announcer:\nNo credit card needed. Thanks, FreshBooks, for sponsoring Tech. Let's jump into the sick pics segment. Today we've got a great choice: gecko grip anti-slip eyeglasses nose pads. As a non-glasses wearer, you may not know, but glasses tend to slide. When I got these, my wife teased me about the rubber gecko strips for my nose, but they work amazingly and aren't noticeable. They're like little rubber gecko feet that go on the nose bridge and stop glasses from sliding. They're temporary, but last for around a month, making glasses much better. They're perfect for those whose glasses slide off, working even when dancing around. Check them out!\n\n51:20 Wes Bos:\nWe recently bought a Samsung Frame TV, the older refurbished version with a matte screen that makes it look like artwork. It's incredible - great sound and visuals, and now it displays art all day. My wife found artwork packs on Etsy to avoid subscribing to Samsung's art service. She's in charge of selecting cool oil paintings for the TV. It's an amazing combo of television and artwork, definitely worth checking out if you're looking for a new TV. I initially doubted its quality due to its thinness, but it proved me wrong. We ultimately chose another Samsung.\n\n52:28 Announcer:\nI liked the qLED 1 we got before. I genuinely enjoy Samsung TVs.\n\n52:35 Wes Bos:\nSome people might be skeptical about Samsung as a brand, but I love their TVs. I've had 3 or 4, and they've been great. However, their fridges aren't so good; we got one in our new house and everyone says they're terrible. We also got a TCL TV, which is like a budget option. It doesn't have a VCR, but it has a built-in Roku, and we've been happy with it. It's more like a kid's TV and a bit dimmer on the corners, but still good. I'm a big fan of the frame.
