Get set with Scott Zelensky and West boss.\n\n00:17 Wes Bos:\nWelcometo syntax,the spookiest web development show in the field.Is that is that German again?\n\n00:29 Scott Tolinski:\nYeah. I don't know. I I got Dracula.I got Dracula.\n\n00:36 Wes Bos:\nIn this episode, we share spooky web development stories involving accidental database deletions, swear words, and other cringe-worthy mistakes. We receive dozens of submissions that are amusing to look back on and can teach valuable lessons about what not to do.\n\n01:04 Scott Tolinski:\nYeah. Straight up, spooky, for sure. That's, like, anytime\n\n01:09 Wes Bos:\nI see ATV crashes on the news and want to know what happened so I don't make the same mistake. Did they go near a cliff? That's my biggest fear. We have a kid's ATV, but I don't want my kids on it. Every time I hear about kids in accidents, I want to know what they did, not to blame them but for safety reasons. Anyway, what are kids not doing? Good point. Sorry for sounding sick, I got the Vid. Thanks to Scott for handling the last episode alone. Feeling better today, and we'll continue with Halloween.\n\n02:02 Scott Tolinski:\nFunny, right? Yeah, the 1 on Friday. Thought this 1 would be before - Oh, - the yeah. Deno, West mentioned TRPC episode with Alex.\n\n02:14 Wes Bos:\nYeah, no worries, man. Sorry about the vid, the dance is no fun. Excited to hear, but bummed that's the 1 I missed. Had lots questions, but sure you did awesome. Good news, I asked many questions because.\n\n02:32 Scott Tolinski:\nturns out I don't know very much about TRPC.So\n\n02:35 Wes Bos:\nIt's time to fill an hour solo. We're sponsored by 3 great companies: Century (error exception & bug tracking), Perrismic (headless CMS for websites), and Freshbooks (cloud accounting). We'll discuss them later. So, Mr. Spooky Tolinski?\n\n03:00 Scott Tolinski:\nYeah.\n\n03:01 Wes Bos:\nWhat's up? Ready to start? I've got the first query here, but we won't mention names or companies for privacy. This person is a longtime listener and a big fan, and they say hi to Scott. Any recommendations for Mexican restaurants where they don't smother the burritos?\n\n03:32 Scott Tolinski:\nSmothering a burrito means adding sauce, like a miele or salsa. There are good Mexican restaurants here, authentic ones on Federal. For ritzier places, try Mister Oso, which is part of a chain with Senior Bear. Great names, but it's tricky for a third one due to the Spanish-English mix.\n\n04:22 Wes Bos:\nThis story took place 5-6 years ago when I worked as a front end developer at an ed-tech company using React. Our product was a database of questions for students to practice different subjects. The screen displayed a list of questions and the main question. We used a single global store for state management, and component state was banned so there was only one source of truth for all state in the app.\n\nHowever, any change in state caused the entire application to rerender. This didn't cause serious issues until we introduced a feature allowing teachers to create assignments and exams. One day, a major client, a school district, reported the product was broken, and multiple classes of students couldn't take an important exam.\n\n06:01 Scott Tolinski:\nIt's awful when actual people sit there during exams, right? Everyone's stressed as is; kinks just make it worse.\n\n06:12 Wes Bos:\nThe exam had hundreds of questions, more than expected in a single exam, which helps discover software limits. The ESLint-side list had infinite scroll, loading more questions as you completed exams. After a few hundred questions, render times took over 30 seconds on a MacBook Pro.\n\n06:54 Scott Tolinski:\nIt's difficult to comprehend. If it exceeds 10 seconds, you'd think it's broken and refresh, right? Definitely.\n\n07:08 Wes Bos:\nExams were timed, and the app became unusable. We quickly added windowing and shouldComponentUpdate to fix the issue, but felt guilty for stressing out teachers. Lesson learned: use windowing for large lists, as infinite scroll is problematic. Windowing renders only visible items, like Twitter or video games do for performance optimization.\n\n08:17 Scott Tolinski:\nPartially, they don't need to store all other vertices in memory. Use React Virtualized and React Window for virtualizing ESLint solutions.\n\n08:37 Wes Bos:\nThat's an 8/10 oof. To increase the oops, money needs to be involved somehow.\n\n08:48 Scott Tolinski:\nYeah. Yeah. Money money makes bigger oops, definitely.\n\n08:52 Wes Bos:\nNeed cash or flights. Recall last year, 1 case involved someone scanning QR codes on logs at a lumberyard due to dropped database.\n\n09:02 Scott Tolinski:\nPersonal health info is bad too. I'd rate this 4 creepy crawlies out of 10. Maybe I'll reevaluate my initial rating. Next, a listener shared a push notification horror story at an enterprise software conference. They supported a legacy web application during migration and discovered the previous developer set up alerts on pages that sent notifications to services like pager duty or x matters. These monitoring services alert on-call staff during weekends if something breaks.\n\n09:58 Wes Bos:\nThey'll ping your phone saying, \"Hey, elevated errors.\" If someone hits a 404 page on your site, it'll ping you, \"Hey, they tried to visit, it's 404-ing. Interesting.\"\n\n10:15 Scott Tolinski:\nI'd only get 1-3 alerts/year for legacy apps with few users. The cybersecurity team requested a pen test, which had to be random. I wasn't worried since the app would be trashed anyway. A week later, while driving home, I got 13,000+ push notifications from the pen test. My phone couldn't handle it, so I turned it off. We implemented flood control after this. I rate this experience 4/10 pumpkins - spooky, but only harming myself. It's a lesson in throttling. Services like Vercel, Pushover, and Pushroll handle cross-platform push notifications.\n\n12:05 Wes Bos:\nOh,\n\n12:06 Scott Tolinski:\nSendGrid is email and maybe does push notifications. Someone in mind uses Trello, which has push notes. Twilio, right. Imagine paying for such a service could be pricey.\n\n12:25 Wes Bos:\nYou say, oh yeah, send a 2 cents push notification. I experienced that when I sold stickers; about 88,000 notifications, 4,000 in an hour, then it stopped. Surprised iOS didn't group or throttle them. Unreal, 13,000 - funny. I saw David Beckham's Instagram showing how it looks on his phone.\n\n13:02 Scott Tolinski:\nWhy have notifications? Must be for the walls. Look how cool I am.\n\n13:12 Wes Bos:\nNext, we have Dark Friday last year. I accidentally deleted 200-300 orders from our error queue during Black Friday, instead of fixing them. When you delete an error, it's like it never happened. I assume an error queue is for orders with issues that need to be addressed. \n\nI asked, \"What happened next?\" They replied, \"Thankfully, the order system refunded them after 2 weeks since they weren't marked as shipped.\" So, 200-300 people missed their Black Friday deals. Bummer.\n\n14:02 Scott Tolinski:\nThis one's kinda spooky, like 6 or 7 ghosts out of 10, yeah.\n\n14:10 Wes Bos:\nGhost set of 11 - fantastic! Next, 1 has no title - wait, I'll find one. Got it, perfect choice! Onward, Tiny Ince.\n\n14:27 Scott Tolinski:\nI tried to create an alternative name based on \"Mo' Money, Mo' Problems.\" I set up an online competition for juniors advertised on TV. I mistakenly used a tiny end for the auto-incrementing ID field in the MySQL database. After 128 entries, the form showed an error. The mistake was discovered on Monday after the TV ad had run all weekend, costing hundreds of thousands of dollars.\n\nMy manager told me to manually import lost entries, unaware of the severity. I still don't know how I kept my job or how management resolved the issue. Perhaps they lied to the client or offered a solution. I then got rated 99 jello eyeballs out of 10, and a three by others.\n\n16:21 Wes Bos:\nCandy corns out of 4 - big money at stake. Someone likely swept it under the rug, and nobody noticed. Probably, bosses or clients didn't want to get in trouble, so everyone stayed quiet.\n\nWorked at a ticketing company using dot net and jQuery. Made about $3 million/day in sales. They changed their strategy to focus on quick A/B tests to raise conversion rates - even small changes could bring extra $200k a day.\n\nDue to the demand for speed, typical development tasks like testing, removing old defunct code, and code reviews were ignored. The code base became a hot mess of tangled and horrifically organized code. This issue is probably more common than we think, especially in large companies.\n\n18:48 Scott Tolinski:\nHere's a costly mistake from the same user. One day, I wrote an A/B test for the last page of the checkout process, where users had to navigate multiple pages for various details. My change moved the confirm purchase button from the bottom to the sidebar for visibility. However, due to no code review, no testing, and deployment on a Friday, it led to a spooky mistake.\n\n19:34 Wes Bos:\nBecause You're not even done and because\n\n19:37 Scott Tolinski:\nRight, no testing and pressure to build fast. Another point here. How many check boxes? Great. Made the change, deployed quickly. In 2 hours, dashboards showed plummeting sales. Confirm purchase button was submit in HTML form. Use the platform.\n\n20:07 Wes Bos:\nUse the platform. Use the platform.\n\n20:10 Scott Tolinski:\nTurns out, I moved the button from the form to the sidebar accidentally, removing it from the AB test. This made it visible to everyone instead of 50% and prevented anyone from checking out, causing a loss of around 1000000.\n\n20:29 Wes Bos:\ndollars in that time.\n\n20:31 Scott Tolinski:\nI maintained my job despite management knowing the risks, and shared my experience through a talk to emphasize the importance of reviews and tests. Thanks to Weston Scott's podcast. I'd rate this 10/10 zombie hands emerging from the ground.\n\n21:00 Wes Bos:\nWow, big money involved! Wonder how much returned or was abandoned? Unreal. I rate it 80.5 pumpkins out of 10.\n\n21:21 Scott Tolinski:\nSuper spooky. This person seemingly had no testing, review process, or staging environment to check for issues. If they did, they might've noticed bugs affecting sales before going live. To avoid such creepy bugs in your code, try Century at century.io. It's a service that collects errors and exceptions, showing their existence and origin, so you can assign and track them effectively.\n\nNo one needs spooky code during this season, with enough spookiness going on outside, like kids in costumes or front yard ghosts. If you want to squash bugs and track performance issues that cause user distress, try century.io with coupon code \"tasty treat\" for 2 free months. Thanks, Century, for sponsoring.\n\n22:48 Wes Bos:\nNext, from Holland, we title this \"Dick League\" or \"Pub League.\" It's about a leak from Holland. My colleague used a file sharing service to send files with credentials and passwords for our databases to others. Not a good move.\n\n23:30 Scott Tolinski:\nFirst of all.\n\n23:32 Wes Bos:\nHe forgot to check the private checkbox, making personal data of millions publicly available on a file-sharing site. It took 30 minutes to fix the error, but the company had to notify users and monitor the situation. They changed database passwords and after a few years, no leaks were detected; but uncertainty remains.\n\n24:35 Scott Tolinski:\nYour your your, like, standard voice is, like, creepy enough right now for me. Yeah.\n\n24:42 Wes Bos:\nThat's nice! I'd rate it 0.5/10 rockets. Know what rockets are?\n\n24:51 Scott Tolinski:\nESLint a candy?\n\n24:53 Wes Bos:\nYeah. You guys call them smarties.\n\n24:55 Scott Tolinski:\nYou call them rockets?\n\n24:57 Wes Bos:\nYeah, Canada has smarties, similar to M&M's. We call them rockets. Wild, huh?\n\n25:09 Scott Tolinski:\n7/10 snake skeletons. Love the podcast; enjoy your positivity. I'm a web developer with 12 years of experience in JS and Pnpm. Spooky story: worked at a large university maintaining their LMS. We had a popular plugin for grade forecasting, but calculating grades was resource-intensive. The plugin was the most used feature.\n\nWeek before finals, the site ran slow. Wasn't involved in DevOps but eventually found the issue: ajax requests for the report were stacking up, and thousands were waiting, blocking other requests. My mistake was not using a debounce function - fixed in 2 minutes, but deployment took days of approval due to bureaucracy.\n\nEmbarrassed, I was sent home. Local news even reported the outage. Thankfully, life moved on. Worst mistake in my dev career. Thanks for the podcast.\n\n32:13 Wes Bos:\nA 10/10 college Halloween party. The writing is hilarious, with situations where a single mistake can create chaos, like forgetting a comma or debounce function. In one spooky story, a country code error led to 500 member cards being mailed to the Falkland Islands instead of the Faroe Islands 20 years ago. It makes one wonder how confused the Falkland Islands mailman must have been. Curious fact: the Falkland Islands has a population of 2,800.\n\n33:14 Scott Tolinski:\nI'd rate it 2/10 centipedes - still fun but not bone-chilling. Mhmm, 1AA3.\n\n33:27 Wes Bos:\nout of 10. It's it's a funny 1. It's a good laugh. Nice, a quick story 1. It's not as bad as the\n\n33:34 Scott Tolinski:\nA few years ago, we accidentally shipped toilet paper in our unit tests. Another personal story involves a client at a major conference where we maintained their application. We hired a freelancer to create a scheduling service like a PWA calendar for the conference.\n\nThe plugin for Drupal worked well during testing, with sorting, filtering, and adding events to Google Calendar. However, we didn't test it with many users simultaneously. At the conference, the app had an infinite scroll feature that sent tons of requests, effectively DDoSing the system and making it useless.\n\nThe worst part is that the app was developed by a freelancer, not our team. My coworker, who was attending the conference, had to fix the app in a hotel room, parsing code he didn't write. He couldn't enjoy the conference while I stayed at home base, texting him for updates.\n\n36:35 Wes Bos:\nGreat, time for a quick break to mention our sponsor, Prismic, the online headless website builder that transforms sites into growth engines. Sign up, start building, and upload content through various content types organized into \"slices.\" Developers can make components matching each slice, like a conference component, and easily build pages in Prismic using these slices. It's like a website builder but with more coding freedom. They offer APIs for React, Svelte, PHP, etc. Check it out at prismic.io/syntax.\n\n37:58 Scott Tolinski:\nCheck out Prismic's fun landing page. In 2013, I was tasked with developing a mobile-friendly website for a state department of education budget presentation. Lacking the required text, I used Dr. Who-themed filler text instead of the typical Lorem Ipsum. My coworkers thought it was cool.\n\nI pushed the site draft to production for my boss to review over the weekend, thinking no one else would see it. On Monday, the state superintendent looked unhappy and wanted to speak with me. Turns out, my boss had shared the link with others, including state legislators, who believed our website had been hacked due to the strange phrases.\n\nI faced potential termination and spent the day seeking new job opportunities. Later, I discovered my boss hadn't realized the site was going to be shared externally. Everyone agreed to only use Lorem Ipsum moving forward. I learned my lesson and narrowly avoided losing my job due to using filler text from a British sci-fi show.\n\n41:55 Wes Bos:\nIs there a magic trick?\n\n41:57 Scott Tolinski:\nRight? Imagine getting fired, then doing a magic trick, making the boss rethink everything. It's like, \"This guy does magic. Alright.\"\n\n42:14 Wes Bos:\nMaybe it was just like it was like access cards.\n\n42:17 Scott Tolinski:\nOh, no worries. He explains it in the next paragraph. When he first became state superintendent, he gave us \"get out of jail free\" cards for mistakes. I had mine and coworkers gave me theirs too, which was wholesome. It was a great lesson, and I found out I had incredible friends at the office. I'm still working there, and even though he's not superintendent anymore, I keep the cards as a reminder of my mistake and the amazing people I've worked with. Cute ending, sorry for joking earlier. \n\nYour boss should've said something or not sent it to you. They needed to step up. But how many times have you experienced that, where your boss...\n\n43:16 Wes Bos:\nInsert Laura Mipsum as a placeholder and they get distracted. Don't focus on that, but anything else. What's with the nonsense words?\n\n43:31 Scott Tolinski:\nYeah. Is this Latin?\n\n43:32 Wes Bos:\nYes, totally had the exact experience. There's even a font that puts placeholder.\n\n43:43 Scott Tolinski:\nlike lines or, like, text-like but actual words. Yeah.\n\n43:49 Wes Bos:\nInteresting, like a skeleton text. Good story, I like it. Moving on, I'm on a payment team for a marketplace. We collect money when customers buy products, then pay merchants. One new merchant was receiving payments but still submitting legal papers for processing. Seems like they need a payment's hub, like Scott - not a sponsor, but would be a great transition.\n\n44:29 Scott Tolinski:\nYes, an earlier situation could have utilized one of our incident response sponsors.\n\n44:35 Wes Bos:\nAfter 2 months of payments, our payment provider refunded customers due to incomplete paperwork. Customers were confused, merchants angry. We were allowed to recollect the money after completing paperwork. I wrote a script for batch processing recollections. Our operations team provided an Excel file with transaction information, but Excel caused issues with monetary values, dates, and 16-digit transaction codes, turning them into exponent values.\n\nI exported the Excel to CSV, but transaction codes were rounded, so each was incorrect. Upon discovering this during a test, we fixed the issue. After much verification, we finally recollected the funds - the most challenging week of my job.\n\n46:30 Scott Tolinski:\nThat's a good one. This time of year, as we end the fiscal year, consider our sponsor FreshBooks; perfect for invoicing clients and tracking small business payments.\n\n46:48 Wes Bos:\nI had the best time this year when we got a new person at Freshbooks for sponsorships, and we sent them the invoice. They asked when it's coming, and I said my assistant will send it in an hour or two from Freshbooks. They really liked that.\n\n47:11 Scott Tolinski:\nGot a lot of it. And then\n\n47:13 Wes Bos:\nI forgot to mark an invoice as paid, and my client noticed it through Freshbooks, a cloud accounting service. Clients can view all past invoices and their statuses. I can also see which invoices I paid and when, and directly turn them into expenses. Freshbooks is great for small businesses to get paid faster. Visit freshbooks.com/syntax for a 30-day free trial. Thanks, Freshbooks, for sponsoring.\n\n47:57 Scott Tolinski:\nCool, so it's time for sick picks - awesome things we recommend. I have a life-changing sick pick for you, Wes. As an iPhone user, I love the magsafe magnetic back feature, but hate bulky wallets. So, I got a magnetic pop socket wallet from PopSocket, compatible with magsafe. It securely holds cards, attaches to the phone, and includes a pop socket.\n\nAfter researching on YouTube, I found that PopSocket has the strongest attachment. The convenience of the pop socket is amazing; in fact, I can't imagine not having it. It avoids the pinky problem and is even better than stick-on ones I used with my Android phone. Plus, it can still charge magnetically.\n\nNow, I only need my phone and car key when leaving the house. So that's my sick pick!\n\n50:21 Scott Tolinski:\nYour car uses a single fob key, and Hyundai claims future updates may allow using your phone as a key. Initially, your car required a flash drive for updates, but now it has over-the-air updates. The software is still developing but isn't available on your phone yet.\n\n51:01 Wes Bos:\nI bought a water flosser after my dentist's recommendation. I decided on an Amazon one instead of an expensive Waterpik. It's great quality, and I love using it every night. The battery life is impressive; after 3 weeks and one charge, it's still going strong. I appreciate not having to constantly charge it, unlike other devices that need docks. The water pressure is also excellent.\n\n52:08 Scott Tolinski:\nOur electric toothbrush dock is like a glass cup on a stand, and I dislike it. It's gross, and you can't be sure if it's connected and charging or not, unlike an actual dock. It's unreliable and frustrating.\n\n52:35 Wes Bos:\nJust give me, let me, due to old tools having NICAD batteries with short life. New stuff has efficient motors and lithium ion batteries - be careful, don't drop in water.\n\n52:54 Scott Tolinski:\nThey're forever-lasting and incredible. Waterflosser. Never had one but now a changed person. Got one on a prime deal, requires plugging in, but worth it. That's all for spooky stories, more to come in the next episode.\n\n53:22 Wes Bos:\nsubmit your spooky story to me, west@westbos.com. We collect stories year-round for next year's book.\n\n53:31 Scott Tolinski:\nUp to now, sick. Well, shameless plug: LevelUpTutorials.com. Huge redesign, maybe done when you hear this, fingers crossed. November release maybe, working hard. Keep checking, massive makeover.\n\n53:54 Wes Bos:\nMajor glow up!
