Strap in and get ready!\n\n00:11 Wes Bos:\nWelcome to Syntax, the tastiest web development podcast. Today we ask: Can Vanilla CSS replace all SAS features? We discuss nesting in CSS and whether it makes sense to switch from SAS or start a new project using Vanilla CSS. We'll review each SAS feature and give it a replaceable thumbs up, plausible, or no. It's like a mythbusters episode for web development. How are you doing today, Scott?\n\n01:01 Scott Tolinski:\nI'm good, man. Beautiful weather here. I've been in the yard, picking up leaves. Feels awesome! Had a great Easter Sunday. How was yours? Oh, pretty good, actually.\n\n01:22 Wes Bos:\nMy sister visited for Easter and we enjoyed a big ham. The kids loved it, so it was a great Easter. They're still home today for Easter Monday, which I don't remember getting two days off for. I've never heard of Easter Monday before.\n\n01:41 Scott Tolinski:\nI thought, is that a thing? I asked Courtney when Easter is and she gave me a look like, come on, man. It's tomorrow. I'm not the best at remembering that stuff. We did a neighborhood kids' egg hunt and it was great. The family hosting did an amazing job. There were about 50 kids and no meltdowns. All the kids left happy. They were impressive hosts, even providing something for adults too. It was a nice Easter weekend. We did egg stuff, and my daughter loves bunnies, so she went crazy with all the bunny things. It's been a very bunny weekend for us.\n\n02:53 Wes Bos:\nOur backyard is bunny central, and our kids love watching them hop around. We also have many falcons in the neighborhood that often perch on light posts and swoop down to grab prey. The other day, we spotted half a bunny on the ground and had to explain to the kids that falcons enjoy eating bunnies.\n\n03:20 Scott Tolinski:\nI found a week-old bunny carcass in our front yard, which was the one we'd always see. I had to remove it before my daughter saw it. Despite having no falcons, we surprisingly have many bald eagles in Denver. I never used to see them, but now they appear in parks and on Reddit photos.\n\n03:52 Wes Bos:\nYeah, we have a large banner in Hamilton featuring an eagle, signifying their return after 40 years. Their numbers have increased, which is cool. I'm not a patriotic American, but I appreciate a cool bird.\n\n04:13 Scott Tolinski:\nThese cool birds are impressive, standing tall like people. Alright, let's dive in.\n\n04:20 Wes Bos:\nWe'll examine SAS features, determining if they're replaceable and discuss alternatives. This isn't against compiling CSS, as you'll still need tools like post CSS for optimization, nor is it an anti-SAS argument. With jQuery, web standards evolved and it became less needed. Similarly, as CSS gains more features, we may not need SAS anymore.\n\n05:25 Scott Tolinski:\nBefore being labeled a CSS Purist like that YouTuber, I want to clarify that my career started with SaaS tutorials and Compass tutorials. I've been a huge SaaS fan for a long time. However, if I say anything pro-browser-based CSS, it's not because I'm anti-SaaS. I still love SaaS, but we might not need it as much for certain tasks. Similar to how we view jQuery, some tasks might be better suited to different approaches. So, let's dive into that.\n\n06:06 Wes Bos:\nWant to discuss post CSS first? It's a bundler transformer for CSS, allowing plugins like auto-prefixer to add vendor prefixes based on browser support. Surprisingly, some things still need prefixes, like CSS gradient requiring -webkit-mask. Oddly, Chrome hasn't \"un-prefixed\" it, though Firefox and others support regular mask. Post CSS works for older browsers too.\n\n07:46 Scott Tolinski:\nYeah, vendor prefixing for CSS was a thing during the early development career when CSS 3 dropped with new features and browser prefixes. It led to the need for tools like SaaS, but as the web evolved, we started thinking less about prefixes, and people started using tools like post CSS to compile CSS and handle browser support.\n\nPost CSS, like Babbel, targets specific browser versions for support and has a plugin ecosystem for adding specific CSS features, supporting prefixes, removing unused code, and more. Even without using Sassy CSS or other tools, post CSS is used in almost every project to provide baseline coverage.\n\n09:53 Wes Bos:\nFirstly, variables are well supported in all browsers. Using regular CSS variables is better due to their live updates in the client. Though the syntax is funky, it's easy to get used to. Changing a variable causes updates to ripple throughout the entire application.\n\n10:30 Scott Tolinski:\nYou can scope specific selectors with variables, which we'll discuss more with mixins. Scoping is essential as we see a shift towards scope CSS in frameworks, CSS and JS frameworks, and web components. CSS variables provide an interface to update these elements in a more controlled manner, making it easier to override and augment properties.\n\nVariables are crucial for dealing with dark mode, light mode, themes, and sizes. They also have default values, allowing for easy customization and overriding. CSS variables are among the greatest improvements in CSS, differing from Sass variables that only exist at compile time and are limited for dynamic situations.\n\n12:19 Wes Bos:\nThat's a quick variable find and replace, working better than expected. I posted about discussing colors soon and showed how changing one variable updates the rest. Many said they'd prefer pre-compiling to avoid using users' resources and CPU for opacity calculations. However, I can get any color with this method. If I pre-calculated 20 colors and 8 variations each, that's 160 color combinations. So, what's better: calculating in ESLint or shipping extra CSS for all situations?\n\n13:37 Scott Tolinski:\nNot certain, but show me the inflow. Shameful, wasteful use of people's network, not considering usage, West. Can't win.\n\n13:53 Wes Bos:\nNext, we have CSS nesting, which just dropped and is the main reason people use SAS. It makes it easier to write a selector and nest another inside it, like selecting links or a specific class within a menu. Nesting can cause issues if overdone, but it's convenient. Now available in Safari Technology Preview, it can be compiled with post CSS to unnested CSS, allowing its use in every browser today.\n\n14:55 Scott Tolinski:\nYes, I really like that nesting has finally found its sweet spot in CSS. Initially, nesting resulted in CSS being indented too deep, and there was a whole \"nesting is harmful\" movement. However, now nesting is useful for scoping components and avoiding repetition of class names or property selectors, providing a nice interface.\n\nWhen Sass introduced nesting, it greatly improved CSS writing, as you didn't have to think about selector nesting as much. Now we have this in-browser, and although some criticize the syntax compared to Sass's, it still brings improvements. In Sass, you just use an ampersand to represent the parent for pseudo selectors. With the new CSS nesting, you almost always have to indicate the parent, but that's due to CSS parsing.\n\nSo, have there been updates to the CSS parser?\n\n17:01 Wes Bos:\nThe approved and released version is very close to SaaS, allowing you to nest a selector inside the parent without needing an ampersand. The ampersand is only necessary when doing element selectors. For instance, with a .wrapper and .sidebar, you can just select .sidebar; but for a div or span, use the & div. Leivaroo has a good GitHub thread explaining that this is related to positive look-ahead regular expressions, and they're exploring removing this requirement in future versions. Despite this minor inconvenience, using an ampersand isn't a big deal, and the current CSS nesting feels and looks great. It seems like it was just a few months ago when SCSS-style nesting wasn't yet figured out.\n\n18:42 Scott Tolinski:\nThe exciting part is that now we have native media query nesting in CSS, a killer feature for many users. You can simply use @media inside a selector and write your CSS within. This has always been a huge aspect of CSS nesting usage, so it was vital for any nesting API that hit browsers to include media queries. Thanks to Adam Argyle's blog post on developers.chrome.com, you can find many practical examples that demonstrate the new nesting rules and syntax. The post covers various use cases and does a great job showing the before and after comparisons.\n\n19:49 Wes Bos:\nA cool feature in SaaS is nesting container queries within nested containers. This allows for easy application without naming the container. Another lesser-known feature is \"breaking out of the selector,\" which can be done using the ampersand at the end of a selector; this works in native CSS as well.\n\nSaaS recently released a blog post about adding native CSS nesting to SaaS. The proposed idea is to include regular CSS in a SaaS file, but it won't compile - this limits the use of SaaS variables. Although not an ideal solution, it's a step forward. Users would still need to post CSS compile for older browser support.\n\n21:54 Scott Tolinski:\nIt's iffy, but you might wonder why to use native nesting when CSS provides the same features. Well, you'd ship less code. While it may not matter much in terms of compression engines, you'll still save by shipping fewer things. When compiling a nested script, it has to inline duplicate selectors based on layers depth, which isn't insignificant, especially with is.\n\n22:29 Wes Bos:\nLike, the classic example is selecting h1-h6 in a card. Before, you'd compile with dot h1 dot H2H3like dot card space h1 comma dot card space h2. Yeah. Now we just use is.\n\n22:54 Scott Tolinski:\nDot card colon includes h1-h6, and it might not make a huge difference in your code compilation. There should be some savings in efficiency, right? \n\nColors in SASS are impressive, but not as dynamic as CSS variables. SASS allows you to compute colors from existing ones, which was a great feature. However, with different SASS APIs and hard-to-parse documentation, using SASS color functions has become frustrating. Currently not using SASS, the future of manipulating colors in the browser looks promising with new features like color mix, contrast, and relative colors. \n\nThe downside to this is losing the semantic function names, which is something SASS does well.\n\n24:43 Wes Bos:\nDarkened Leitchen, dark, requires using relative color or color mix function. Built-in color functions depend on browser support, can't be compiled away, but could be polyfilled with JavaScript. You can pass one color, e.g., Freshbooks invoicing takes your brand color syntax (yellow) and calculates darker, lighter, and accent colors. Very cool.\n\n25:23 Scott Tolinski:\nListen to color episodes for more on colors in upcoming features.\n\n25:30 Wes Bos:\nOh, we forgot to determine if that was good, better, plausible, or replaceable for these options. Variables are replaceable, as is ESLint. Colors are plausible since they need to be compiled. You could use a post CSS plugin to compile at build time, providing the same outcome as SaaS but without live support for older browsers. You could also use support queries for compatibility.\n\nIn many cases, I prefer writing to the spec rather than using SaaS or a random post CSS plugin, as those might not adhere to the standard. I'll use the spec version and keep things static until browsers support it. For what I'll use, it's post CSS with the preset INV.\n\n27:35 Wes Bos:\nNesting can be compiled to regular selectors, and Deno features aren't missed. I understand the container queries point. Other features can be compiled too. Arrow functions in JavaScript are compatible even with IE6. Features like symbols might be difficult to incorporate. Nesting, however, can be used today and just needs to be compiled.\n\n28:21 Scott Tolinski:\nthe expanded selector, and I don't think you lose anything. When considering if it's fully replaceable without post CSS, well, it isn't. That's why I interjected. I believe you'll always use\n\n28:37 Wes Bos:\nPostCSS: Use preset ENV, specify supported browsers, and it decides whether to compile, transpile, polyfill features or ship directly to browsers, based on their support. No need to do so if all browsers support it.\n\n29:00 Scott Tolinski:\nTotally. Let's discuss looping, which isn't in CSS now but is in SaaS. With loops, you can increment numbers and use them for various properties, like math and color work. I remember using loops for things modern CSS can do, like nth child. Before, we'd loop to apply styles every third item, but now we have nth child for that. Even with layouts, we used loops for grid systems, floating and percentage widths. But now, we have grid and flexbox, so I wonder what we'd even use loops for in modern CSS today – I don't have a good answer.\n\n30:17 Wes Bos:\nYeah, in most cases, it's not needed with auto-fit, auto-fill, and advanced selectors. You can use a variable for different instances, like assigning different colors for CSS, HTML, JavaScript, and TypeScript. Write a selector with a variable, and pass it inline or as a style attribute. It'll be applied to every single one.\n\nI faced an edge case recently where looping would be helpful. I was creating an HSL color picker and wanted to loop the rainbow with a gradient of every hue from 0 to 360. I tried using a linear gradient from HSL(0) to HSL(360) but got an unexpected color result.\n\n31:53 Scott Tolinski:\nI\n\n31:54 Wes Bos:\nWhat color was the brown? It was red due to 0 degrees HSL being red. The entire rainbow ends at 360, which is also red. I created a gradient from red to red, hitting every stop along the way. To achieve this, I added a stop every 45 degrees. With such a large selector, CSS couldn't be used without a loop or math. I added 8 stops, each at a specific degree. This situation might arise in animations as well.\n\n32:46 Scott Tolinski:\nYeah, whenever you need to automate something mathematical, there's a place for it. It's funny because I just\n\n32:59 Wes Bos:\nThose end cases are super edgy. You know what excels at looping over data?\n\n33:09 Scott Tolinski:\nWhat? That sounds like a sponsored transition. Oh, no.\n\n33:13 Wes Bos:\nToday's episode brought to you by JavaScript.\n\n33:16 Scott Tolinski:\nYes. Alright.\n\n33:17 Wes Bos:\nPeople may dismiss ESLint styles, but they are great for passing variables into selectors and overriding them. Instead, I could have used a \"background\" variable and looped over it with React or Svelte when generating HTML. However, it's not in the same place, so I'll give this point to SAS while acknowledging that ESLint styles have their advantages as well.\n\n33:55 Scott Tolinski:\nYou likely don't need most cases, so I want to tackle those. I understand your love for using JavaScript and CSS with ESLint or Svelte's property to define CSS variables as props. It's great using JavaScript and CSS together like this for me too.\n\nLet's discuss Mixins or extends, which allow you to write one piece of CSS functionality that can be applied to multiple classes. Though it sounds like just a class, Mixins function more like functions as they can accept inputs, acting as small utilities without needing a separate class. However, this might lead to questions about reusable CSS and whether it's too repetitive.\n\nI believe Mixins could be a useful feature in CSS, though I'm open to being convinced otherwise. It's not a necessity, but it has potential benefits.\n\n35:33 Wes Bos:\nI wasn't a fan of mixins, as it was difficult to locate their origin when compiled. Perhaps I wasn't great with Sass, but I preferred using variables. For example, with border radius and padding adjustments, you can pass a CSS variable and calculate based on that. I reviewed Sass documentation and asked GPT for 10 mixin examples, but couldn't find one that couldn't be replaced by adding a second class or passing a varying component through a variable.\n\n36:35 Scott Tolinski:\nYeah, I'd love to go through my level up tutorials repo while we talk, checking the 2016 version to see what mixins I used then. I recall really liking them. It's interesting how things evolve, and how CSS variables have changed a lot. With the scoping for variables tied to a specific class, it reduces the need for mixins.\n\n37:17 Wes Bos:\nMixins in general had a proposal in the CSS working group called \"apply.\" It allowed setting a CSS variable with multiple properties. You'd define a variable, e.g., dash dash cool corners, followed by colon and curly brackets with different properties inside. The proposal introduced \"at apply\" to apply those properties to a selector. However, it was scrapped due to scoping and CSS variable issues. After reading a blog post explaining why it doesn't work, it's unlikely this feature will be implemented in native CSS. Instead, focus on alternative approaches to solve the problem. So, is that replaceable, plausible, or missing?\n\n38:26 Scott Tolinski:\nI I would go as far as saying it's missing,but Like I said, it's replaceable.\n\n38:31 Wes Bos:\nI mean,\n\n38:33 Scott Tolinski:\nI oscillate on this topic because, while there may be edge cases where mixin functionality can't be replicated, I question if it's necessary to do so, or if there are other valid solutions for those functions. I'll revisit if there's anything particular I wish to retain from mixins. Please, send us at pnpm XFM.\n\n39:07 Wes Bos:\nTweet us your mixing codes and say, okay hot shot, let's see how you handle this. I have a unique edge case and I dislike when people say don't use that without knowing my app's use cases. I’d like to see a decent solution that isn't terrible with setting variables and looping JavaScript.\n\n39:34 Scott Tolinski:\nYes. Yes, please.\n\n39:36 Wes Bos:\nPartials is next. Including CSS in separate files allows for better organization and importing. However, CSS imports can cause waterfalling, where multiple requests occur in sequence, slowing down your experience. This issue persists even with HTTP/2, as it's a browser-related problem.\n\nTwo solutions from Vercel are: 1) bundling CSS into a single file or loading only necessary bits on specific pages, and 2) using preload. For instance, Google Fonts provides a link rel=preload to preload font requests. This informs the browser to fetch the font early, avoiding delays when it's needed later.\n\n41:18 Scott Tolinski:\ntag in Google fonts does. This seems prime for a CSS glow up. The syntax is mostly what everyone uses in SaaS. It's just the functionality, right? How the browser handles import; if it changed from waterfall, would things break? I don't know enough. Am I\n\n41:46 Wes Bos:\nThe issue with JavaScript modules is that the browser doesn't know what it needs until it downloads and parses the file. There was a proposal for the server to parse your CSS and TypeScript, walking the entire import tree, and then send all the required files in a single HTTP 2 request. However, this requires buy-in from the Vercel, which we don't have yet. Bundling is a solution, but requiring server buy-in for CSS doesn't seem right. There was a hinting header where you can hint to the browser about potential downloads, but it was scrapped.\n\n43:00 Scott Tolinski:\nHe might be. You might wonder, what do we download later? Maybe some CSS. I like how importing works in SaaS, but it's a missed feature. I use post CSS to do the same thing with post CSS import, so it's fine in my current setup. However, I wish there was a valid solution for browser import without negative impact.\n\nI first encountered import heavily in Magento codebases. With ESLint and Magento themes, there was heavy usage of import. I thought, \"You can do this?\" That's when I learned about the debate on whether to use it or not.\n\n43:59 Wes Bos:\nYes, it's fantastic as we manage our JavaScript modules by placing everything in separate files. While we miss the SAS feature, using Post CSS Import plugin, which goes against the spec, lets you compile everything into a single file.\n\n44:30 Scott Tolinski:\nTotally. Math & CSS, so great. If you told 2011 me about features in this episode, like calc, min, max, clamp, & ABS in the browser - mind blown!\n\n45:15 Scott Tolinski:\nYes, it's extremely helpful. I didn't know it's in the browser. Let's check the support.\n\n45:23 Wes Bos:\nBefore we tell everybody to use it. Yeah. Everybody.\n\n45:26 Scott Tolinski:\nDrop what you're doing and use absolute brother.\n\n45:29 Wes Bos:\nDefinitely. Regarding Bos, it's supported in IE since 10, Safari since 11, and Chrome since 52. It has been in every browser, just like I've been consistently hitting the gym. That's the CSS property - absolute position.\n\n45:56 Scott Tolinski:\nCSS position absolute, brand new. I'm wrong. Alright.\n\n46:01 Wes Bos:\nSafari 15.4 supports CSS Box, seeking a post CSS plugin. Never used absolute in code, just calc value.\n\n46:17 Scott Tolinski:\nOh no, you can't use a calculator. Absolute value is crucial. You know, there's sine and cosine in CSS too. Can you believe that?\n\n46:35 Wes Bos:\nYes, no, not in CSS. But to fix this, use CSS Max. Pass the actual value and the same value times -1, it'll always give the positive version. Makes sense, right? For example, if you have -10, pass it -10 and -10 times -1, which gives 10. If it's 10, pass 10 and 10 times -1 equals -1. In both cases, Max returns positive 10.\n\n47:22 Scott Tolinski:\nYeah, use variables for upper and lower bounds. If working with variables, you can use sincos and pnpm for interesting animation examples. Though not yet used, sine and cosine have more support than absolute value.\n\n47:58 Wes Bos:\nWow, I didn't know this was in there. Yeah, you could do neat rotation values on that. I did it once with the eyeballs story – remember?\n\n48:12 Scott Tolinski:\nI don't recall an eyeball story, but I was doing some face detection.\n\n48:19 Wes Bos:\nThe browser-based face detection identifies the face and both eyes' locations. To rotate the box around the face based on head motion, I used Sign Coast or tan to determine the angle between two points with different x and y coordinates. Math, man.\n\n48:49 Scott Tolinski:\nOnce your kid enters high school, you'll need to help with their homework, even subjects like trigonometry and accounting. I recall being good at math and even completed a rigorous high school math program that spanned three books in two years. While I don't use much math today, it's a fun skill to have.\n\nSpeaking of functions, they work great in SaaS, allowing you to pass values, perform operations, and return results. I often use functions in CSS and create my own in SaaS, but with JavaScript-based functions in CSS, we enter Deno and Houdini territory. Houdini aimed to bring JavaScript APIs to CSS, enabling us to write custom properties. However, Houdini's progress has stagnated; it is a thing but not really.\n\nHoudini's momentum was strong a few years back, with a website tracking property support across browsers. While some Paint APIs have shipped in most browsers (except Safari and Firefox), many features remain in development or under consideration. The lack of progress in Deno and Houdini is disappointing, but it doesn't diminish the usefulness of functions in programming.\n\n52:01 Wes Bos:\nThis website lists Opera as a browser, but sadly, progress on the Firefox front is slow. The situation with Firefox is due to fewer staff and fewer people to work on it, resulting in lagging features. We might see more of this in the coming year, considering the fast-paced CSS developments and layoffs. Kudos to the remaining workers on these tasks, as they have countless features to implement and face criticism on Twitter about Firefox's shortcomings.\n\n52:56 Scott Tolinski:\nI know, it's funny. I tweeted about Firefox lacking support for something, and it's interesting. My tweet's premise and tone wasn't negative towards Firefox. Instead, I wondered if others noticed the trend where Firefox misses some features, unlike Safari. For a long time, Safari was the one lagging behind. That was my only point, but many comments misunderstood.\n\nI acknowledge the hard work Firefox developers put in, especially amidst layoffs. I feel bad for the workload they face. My aim isn't to criticize individuals, but to discuss trends.\n\n53:56 Wes Bos:\nI think all the \"Safari's the new IE\" tweets reached Tim Apple since Safari has been working on numerous features like CSS relative color, color contrast, and nesting. Often, I test them on Safari technology preview as they're the first to implement these features - kudos to them. But I wish Mozilla would do the same because Firefox makes most of their money through Google search, which relies on people using their browser. Although they have many projects attempting to make money, their primary source depends on browser usage and supporting features.\n\n54:56 Scott Tolinski:\nThe bigwigs at Mozilla could provide more resources. I've heard Mozilla's higher-ups can be tough for Firefox development teams, though I don't want to speak out of turn. Regardless, back to functions, they're not present in CSS.\n\n55:23 Wes Bos:\nYep, we're unsure about this status. The Houdini part, called the typed object model, should provide this and has good support. Yeah, well.\n\n55:37 Scott Tolinski:\nExcept for Firefox, it's shipped in Chrome Safari, has a W3Cspec working draft, and is under consideration. Not in Firefox development yet.\n\n55:52 Wes Bos:\nWe'll see. It's a clear win for SaaS when it comes to not requiring named functions or Houdini JavaScript worklets for custom functionality. It would be great to have a named function like \"darken\" in Vercel to handle color specs.\n\nQuickly moving on to BEM syntax—SaaS excels with block-element-modifier (BEM) syntax, like \"card\" (block), \"card__title\" (element), and \"card__title--large\" (modifier). Writing in SaaS enables concatenating selectors, which is absent in CSSpnpm. So, SaaS is the winner in this aspect as well.\n\n57:17 Scott Tolinski:\nWith CSS nesting, much is possible as CSS keeps evolving. We haven't explored all edge cases or strategies, and new techniques appear daily. Shout out to those experimenting with CSS! So, what do you think - can you drop ESLint 2023? Should you drop SAS?\n\n58:01 Wes Bos:\nIs SaaS terrible? Not necessarily, but for new projects, I'd choose vanilla CSS due to future trends. You can replicate most features by approaching it differently and embracing CSS methods. Be flexible and willing to relearn some techniques.\n\n58:39 Scott Tolinski:\nYeah, me too. I've been happy doing my SaaS stuff for a while. We just laid out that there are plenty of things you can do without diving into SaaS and dealing with its various versions. So, that's it for this episode. West, do you have a sick pick for us? I have an amazing one. It's a cotton product, surprisingly not everyone is allowed to buy it, but we got it.\n\n59:14 Wes Bos:\ncandy machine.\n\n59:16 Scott Tolinski:\nIt's amazing.\n\n59:17 Wes Bos:\nIt's unbelievable. I posted on Twitter about buying a cotton candy machine and some criticized my parenting. But hear me out. We hold our kids' birthday parties at home and a cotton candy machine costs around $200. It's almost commercial quality and super fast for making cotton candy. You can buy sugar or grind up any candy; I've even used Werther's for flavored cotton candy.\n\nWe bought it considering 17 years of birthdays for our 3 kids. Last year, our kids' school had a cotton candy machine at their fair, but it was a slow, cheap one which caused a 45-minute wait. We decided to be the cotton candy family at school, helping raise money and providing efficient service. So, I highly recommend getting a cotton candy machine for your family.\n\n01:00:57 Scott Tolinski:\nIncredible! When I saw that, I wondered, did he actually buy it or is he just renting and joking? I didn't know - you could also rent it. I also thought.\n\n01:01:09 Wes Bos:\nI want my kids to have entrepreneurial skills, like renting out a game machine on Facebook Marketplace for $60 per birthday party. When they're older, they can rent it to someone and make money.\n\n01:01:26 Scott Tolinski:\nFor $60 a day, you can make good money, as we knew a family in Michigan who had a business with tables and stuff. Anyway, I'm getting some solar lanterns for the backyard. Courtney ordered these LED lanterns connected to a battery and solar panel, and they're amazing. We don't know the impact of leaves on them yet, but our backyard looks enchanting with them hanging from tree branches. They're cute fairy lights inside a glass jar with a solar panel and battery. It charges the battery, looks beautiful, and our backyard feels like a charming village at night with these glass containers.\n\n01:02:43 Wes Bos:\nwith the oh, this is a lot nicer than a lot of the, like,LED.\n\n01:02:49 Scott Tolinski:\nThey're not junky or expensive, but the LED and solar panel parts have become very affordable, making the casing nice too. Courtney got cute hooks for hanging them on trees, and they're all over our backyard. Highly recommended for the immaculate vibes.\n\n01:03:16 Wes Bos:\nI believe I've mentioned this before, but go get some dielectric grease and spray it into the battery area of your outdoor lights. We have some at our cottage under the steps, and they're great even after being covered in snow for months. However, they did corrode a bit, so I cleaned and applied dielectric grease to the electrical connections. This prevents water intrusion and corrosion, and they've been working perfectly for 3 years now.\n\n01:04:04 Scott Tolinski:\nHot tip. Yeah.\n\n01:04:06 Wes Bos:\nAlright. That's it.
