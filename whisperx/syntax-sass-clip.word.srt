It

5
00:00:01,761 --> 00:00:01,901

18
00:00:06,464 --> 00:00:06,724
you're

19
00:00:06,744 --> 00:00:07,165
supporting.

20
00:00:07,185 --> 00:00:07,565
It's

21
00:00:07,625 --> 00:00:07,845
pretty

22
00:00:07,905 --> 00:00:08,245
simple.

23
00:00:09,386 --> 00:00:09,546
And

24
00:00:09,846 --> 00:00:09,887
I

25
00:00:09,927 --> 00:00:10,007
was

26
00:00:10,067 --> 00:00:10,307
actually

27
00:00:10,327 --> 00:00:10,647
surprised

28
00:00:10,667 --> 00:00:10,727
the

31
00:00:11,027 --> 00:00:11,508
I

32
00:00:12,468 --> 00:00:12,688
found

33
00:00:12,728 --> 00:00:13,009
something

34
00:00:13,029 --> 00:00:13,169
that

35
00:00:13,369 --> 00:00:13,529
did

36
00:00:13,589 --> 00:00:13,769
not

37
00:00:13,829 --> 00:00:14,029

38
00:00:14,069 --> 00:00:14,309

39
00:00:14,349 --> 00:00:14,369

42
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:15,430
still.

43
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:15,670
What

44
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:15,890
was

45
00:00:15,971 --> 00:00:16,031
it?

46
00:00:16,051 --> 00:00:17,151
Yeah,

47
00:00:17,171 --> 00:00:17,211
it

48
00:00:17,271 --> 00:00:17,492
was...

49
00:00:17,512 --> 00:00:18,572
Does

50
00:00:18,592 --> 00:00:18,712

54
00:00:19,473 --> 00:00:19,613

55
00:00:19,633 --> 00:00:19,853

00:00:20,173 --> 00:00:21,474
prefix?

59
00:00:22,135 --> 00:00:22,195
I

60
00:00:22,315 --> 00:00:22,515
think

61
00:00:22,575 --> 00:00:22,635
it

62
00:00:22,755 --> 00:00:23,055
does,

63
00:00:23,195 --> 00:00:23,275
or

64
00:00:23,315 --> 00:00:23,495
maybe

65
00:00:23,535 --> 00:00:23,656
it's

66
00:00:23,696 --> 00:00:24,076
custom.

67
00:00:24,176 --> 00:00:24,216
I

68
00:00:24,256 --> 00:00:24,396
know

69
00:00:24,456 --> 00:00:24,536
the

70
00:00:24,636 --> 00:00:24,896

71
00:00:24,936 --> 00:00:25,117

72
00:00:25,157 --> 00:00:25,237

74
00:00:25,977 --> 00:00:26,197
still

75
00:00:26,257 --> 00:00:26,738
requires

76
00:00:26,758 --> 00:00:26,998

77
00:00:28,881 --> 00:00:29,141
things.

78
00:00:29,201 --> 00:00:29,281
But

79
00:00:29,321 --> 00:00:29,461
that's

80
00:00:29,501 --> 00:00:29,642
not

81
00:00:29,662 --> 00:00:29,702

84
00:00:31,023 --> 00:00:31,103
I

85
00:00:31,143 --> 00:00:31,263
made

86
00:00:31,303 --> 00:00:31,343

it

91
00:00:32,224 --> 00:00:32,345
one

92
00:00:32,385 --> 00:00:32,605
sec.

93
00:00:32,865 --> 00:00:33,085
Let's

94
00:00:33,246 --> 00:00:33,426
let's

95
00:00:33,486 --> 00:00:33,706
pause

96
00:00:33,766 --> 00:00:33,886
this

97
00:00:33,946 --> 00:00:34,006
a

98
00:00:34,026 --> 00:00:34,187
sec.

99
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:35,390
Oh,

100
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:35,530
it

101
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:35,750
was,

102
00:00:36,371 --> 00:00:36,431
it

103
00:00:36,451 --> 00:00:36,591
was

104
00:00:36,651 --> 00:00:36,731
the

107
00:00:38,572 --> 00:00:38,712
You

108
00:00:38,752 --> 00:00:39,073
have,

109
00:00:39,153 --> 00:00:39,333
you

110
00:00:39,413 --> 00:00:39,673
have

111
00:00:39,733 --> 00:00:39,833
to

112
00:00:40,093 --> 00:00:40,314
use

113
00:00:40,694 --> 00:00:40,974
dash

114

116
00:00:42,355 --> 00:00:42,675

117
00:00:42,715 --> 00:00:42,756

119
00:00:42,996 --> 00:00:43,276
straight

120
00:00:43,316 --> 00:00:43,436

00:00:43,536 --> 00:00:43,996
mask.

122
00:00:44,597 --> 00:00:44,897
And

123
00:00:44,917 --> 00:00:45,057
it's,

124
00:00:45,237 --> 00:00:45,358
it's

125
00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:45,998
hilarious

126
00:00:46,058 --> 00:00:46,378
because

127
00:00:46,598 --> 00:00:46,799
even

128
00:00:46,899 --> 00:00:47,559

136
00:00:51,983 --> 00:00:52,163
well.

137
00:00:52,183 --> 00:00:52,623
Because

138
00:00:52,643 --> 00:00:52,823
so

139
00:00:52,843 --> 00:00:52,983
many

140
00:00:53,023 --> 00:00:53,204
people

141
00:00:53,224 --> 00:00:53,304
are

142
00:00:53,344 --> 00:00:53,464
just

143
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:53,744
doing

144
00:00:53,804 --> 00:00:53,944
that.

145
00:00:53,964 --> 00:00:54,184
They're

146
00:00:54,204 --> 00:00:54,344
like,

147
00:00:54,885 --> 00:00:54,985
oh,

148
00:00:55,005 --> 00:00:55,105
you

149
00:00:55,125 --> 00:00:55,345
forgot

150
00:00:55,365 --> 00:00:55,425
to

151
00:00:55,465 --> 00:00:55,625
put

152
00:00:55,645 --> 00:00:55,826

155
00:00:56,686 --> 00:00:56,766
on.

156
00:00:57,147 --> 00:00:57,287
But

157
00:00:57,647 --> 00:00:57,867
so

158
00:00:58,067 --> 00:00:58,247
every

159
00:00:58,287 --> 00:00:58,688

160
00:00:58,868 --> 00:00:59,268

163
00:01:00,389 --> 00:01:00,729
whatever,

168
00:01:03,414 --> 00:01:03,534
But

169
00:01:03,574 --> 00:01:03,694

170
00:01:03,734 --> 00:01:04,055
whatever

171
00:01:04,115 --> 00:01:04,435
reason,

172
00:01:04,616 --> 00:01:04,796
it's

173
00:01:04,876 --> 00:01:05,096
never

174
00:01:05,156 --> 00:01:05,337
been

175
00:01:05,417 --> 00:01:06,078
unprefixed

176
00:01:06,919 --> 00:01:07,620

178
00:01:07,941 --> 00:01:08,081
There's

179
00:01:08,101 --> 00:01:08,301
probably

180
00:01:08,321 --> 00:01:08,341
a

181
00:01:08,361 --> 00:01:08,482
good

182
00:01:08,522 --> 00:01:08,742
reason

183
00:01:08,762 --> 00:01:09,023

it,

185
00:01:09,223 --> 00:01:09,383
but

186
00:01:09,423 --> 00:01:09,463
it

187
00:01:09,503 --> 00:01:09,684
seems

188
00:01:09,724 --> 00:01:09,764
a

189
00:01:09,784 --> 00:01:09,924
bit

190
00:01:09,944 --> 00:01:10,184
silly.

191
00:01:11,709 --> 00:01:12,069
Yeah,

192
00:01:12,169 --> 00:01:12,249
you

193
00:01:12,289 --> 00:01:12,389
know,

194
00:01:12,409 --> 00:01:12,669

199
00:01:14,351 --> 00:01:14,671
certainly

200
00:01:14,731 --> 00:01:15,031

it's

339
00:01:57,956 --> 00:01:58,196

358
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:03,099
So

359
00:02:03,139 --> 00:02:03,239
now

360
00:02:03,259 --> 00:02:03,419
