WEBVTT

00:00.260 --> 00:05.924
is auto prefixer. It will add in the vendor prefixes that are required based on which

00:05.984 --> 00:12.688
browsers you're supporting. It's pretty simple. And I was actually surprised the other day. I found

00:12.728 --> 00:16.031
something that did not work without a vendor prefix still. What was it?

00:16.051 --> 00:21.474
Yeah, it was... Does the scroll bar stuff work without a vendor prefix?

00:22.135 --> 00:26.998
I think it does, or maybe it's custom. I know the input type of range still requires custom

00:28.881 --> 00:34.187
things. But that's not a vendor prefix. I made a tick talk about it one sec. Let's let's pause this a sec.

00:35.310 --> 00:37.772
Oh, it was, it was the CSS gradient.

00:38.572 --> 00:42.095
You have, you have to use dash webkit mask

00:42.355 --> 00:43.996
instead of just straight up mask.

00:44.597 --> 00:48.500
And it's, it's hilarious because even Firefox supports

00:49.321 --> 00:52.163
the, the webkit prefixed version as well.

00:52.183 --> 00:53.944
Because so many people are just doing that.

00:53.964 --> 00:56.766
They're like, oh, you forgot to put the regular version on.

00:57.147 --> 01:00.729
But so every browser, including Safari, Firefox, whatever,

01:00.829 --> 01:02.231
supports just regular mask.

01:03.414 --> 01:07.921
But for whatever reason, it's never been unprefixed in Chrome.

01:07.941 --> 01:10.184
There's probably a good reason behind it, but it seems a bit silly.

01:11.709 --> 01:22.256
Yeah, you know, vendor prefixing for CSS is certainly something that was of a time for anyone out there who remembers the CSS3 please and any of that stuff.

01:22.276 --> 01:33.044
When for a very long time and for, you know, many years in the start of my development career, CSS hadn't seen any major improvements and it was kind of like a done thing.

01:33.104 --> 01:34.705
It was like, this is CSS, right?

01:35.807 --> 01:38.548
But then when CSS3 dropped, we got all these new features,

01:38.568 --> 01:40.129
the browser prefixes and all that stuff,

01:40.549 --> 01:43.650
and then that really is what exploded the need

01:43.690 --> 01:46.071
for tools like SAS, because now all of a sudden

01:46.111 --> 01:48.131
you have these great new features,

01:48.992 --> 01:51.713
you have browser support that's kind of all over the place,

01:51.993 --> 01:53.953
you put in a tool intermediary to there.

01:54.274 --> 01:57.676
And then as the web has evolved, we've gotten more and more CSS properties,

01:57.696 --> 02:00.337
but it's also gotten more and more dialed in in terms of

02:01.038 --> 02:02.899
how these things are being added to the browser.

02:02.959 --> 02:06.080
So now we're not having to think so much about prefixes.

02:06.541 --> 02:09.662
But the problem there is that then becomes people just aren't thinking about

02:10.123 --> 02:11.063
any of that stuff at all.

02:11.463 --> 02:14.705
And then that's why you do end up using a tool like Post-CSS to say,

02:14.765 --> 02:16.086
you know, just just...

02:16.787 --> 02:20.370
you know, post compile my CSS or just compile my CSS,

02:20.731 --> 02:23.153
take care of anything I might have thought about

02:23.213 --> 02:25.154
or not, you know, based on whatever browsers

02:25.214 --> 02:26.936
I need to support and just do it.

02:27.316 --> 02:28.417
Sort of like Babel, right?

02:28.557 --> 02:30.639
Where before Babel came out,

02:30.659 --> 02:32.100
you were having to like really think about,

02:32.120 --> 02:35.343
well, Babel came out pretty early in the scheme of things,

02:35.383 --> 02:37.865
but it's basically allowing you to target

02:38.185 --> 02:41.548
specific browser versions to make sure that stuff supported.

02:42.230 --> 02:46.552
But what's cool about Post-CSS, in addition to that aspect of things, is that there's

02:46.572 --> 02:51.934
just a whole plug-in ecosystem, so you can add plugins for specific CSS features that

02:51.974 --> 02:58.477
are yet to come individually, as well as supporting things like prefixes or removing

02:58.797 --> 03:02.779
unused code or all sorts of things, even changing the language of certain things.

03:03.481 --> 03:10.507
I personally do use Post-CSS even though I don't use a CSS or SAS, SAS-CSS or SCSS or

03:10.527 --> 03:11.148
any of that stuff.

03:11.468 --> 03:16.512
But I do use Post-CSS today, no matter what, pretty much on every project, just to get

03:16.553 --> 03:17.393
a baseline coverage.

03:18.654 --> 03:20.256
So first one we have here is variables.

03:20.456 --> 03:22.038
We've talked about this quite a bit.

03:22.838 --> 03:25.381
Variables are extremely well supported.
